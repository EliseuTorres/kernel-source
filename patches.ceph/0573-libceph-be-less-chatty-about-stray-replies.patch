Subject: [PATCH 573/938] libceph: be less chatty about stray replies
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

There are many (normal) conditions that can lead to us getting
unexpected replies, include cluster topology changes, osd failures,
and timeouts.  There's no need to spam the console about it.
