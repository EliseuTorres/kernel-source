Subject: [PATCH 362/938] libceph: let osd ops determine request data length
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

The length of outgoing data in an osd request is dependent on the
osd ops that are embedded in that request.  Each op is encoded into
a request message using osd_req_encode_op(), so that should be used
to determine the amount of outgoing data implied by the op as it
is encoded.

Have osd_req_encode_op() return the number of bytes of outgoing data
implied by the op being encoded, and accumulate and use that in
ceph_osdc_build_request().

As a result, ceph_osdc_build_request() no longer requires its "len"
parameter, so get rid of it.

Using the sum of the op lengths rather than the length provided is
a valid change because:
    - The only callers of osd ceph_osdc_build_request() are
      rbd and the osd client (in ceph_osdc_new_request() on
      behalf of the file system).
    - When rbd calls it, the length provided is only non-zero for
      write requests, and in that case the single op has the
      same length value as what was passed here.
    - When called from ceph_osdc_new_request(), (it's not all that
      easy to see, but) the length passed is also always the same
      as the extent length encoded in its (single) write op if
      present.

This resolves:
