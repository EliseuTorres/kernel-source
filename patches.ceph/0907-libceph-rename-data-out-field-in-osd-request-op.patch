Subject: [PATCH 907/938] libceph: rename data out field in osd request op
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

There are fields "indata" and "indata_len" defined the ceph osd
request op structure.  The "in" part is with from the point of view
of the osd server, but is a little confusing here on the client
side.  Change their names to use "request" instead of "in" to
indicate that it defines data provided with the request (as opposed
the data returned in the response).

Rename the local variable in osd_req_encode_op() to match.
