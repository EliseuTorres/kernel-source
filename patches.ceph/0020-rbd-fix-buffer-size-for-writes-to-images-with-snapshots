Subject: rbd: fix buffer size for writes to images with snapshots
Git-commit: 03507db631c94a48e316c7f638ffb2991544d617
Patch-mainline: v3.12-rc2
References: FATE#318328 bsc#917884

rbd_osd_req_create() needs to know the snapshot context size to create
a buffer large enough to send it with the message front. It gets this
from the img_request, which was not set for the obj_request yet. This
resulted in trying to write past the end of the front payload, hitting
this BUG:

libceph: BUG_ON(p > msg->front.iov_base + msg->front.iov_len);

Fix this by associating the obj_request with its img_request
immediately after it's created, before the osd request is created.
