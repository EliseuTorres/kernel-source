Subject: [PATCH 236/938] rbd: fix bug in rbd_dev_id_put()
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

In rbd_dev_id_put(), there's a loop that's intended to determine
the maximum device id in use.  But it isn't doing that at all,
the effect of how it's written is to simply use the just-put id
number, which ignores whole purpose of this function.

Fix the bug.
