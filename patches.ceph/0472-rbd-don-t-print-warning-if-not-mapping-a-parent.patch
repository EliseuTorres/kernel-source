Subject: [PATCH 472/938] rbd: don't print warning if not mapping a parent
References: fate#312983
Git-commit: c734b79655a91a24afcae73738a43a0db09a801a
Patch-mainline: v3.10

The presence of the LAYERING bit in an rbd image's feature mask does
not guarantee the image actually has a parent image.  Currently that
bit is set only when a clone (i.e., image with a parent) is created,
but it is (currently) not cleared if that clone gets flattened back
into a "normal" image.  A "parent_id" query will leave the
parent_spec for the image being mapped a null pointer, but will not
return an error.

Currently, whenever an image with the LAYERED feature gets mapped, a
warning about the use of layered images gets printed.  But we don't
want to do this for a flattened image, so print the warning only
if we find there is a parent spec after the probe.
