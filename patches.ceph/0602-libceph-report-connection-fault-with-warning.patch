Subject: [PATCH 602/938] libceph: report connection fault with warning
References: fate#312983
Git-commit: 28362986f8743124b3a0fda20a8ed3e80309cce1
Patch-mainline: v3.8-rc2

When a connection's socket disconnects, or if there's a protocol
error of some kind on the connection, a fault is signaled and
the connection is reset (closed and reopened, basically).  We
currently get an error message on the log whenever this occurs.

A ceph connection will attempt to reestablish a socket connection
repeatedly if a fault occurs.  This means that these error messages
will get repeatedly added to the log, which is undesirable.

Change the error message to be a warning, so they don't get
logged by default.
