Subject: [PATCH 855/938] ceph: update "ceph_features.h"
References: fate#312983
Git-commit: ec73a754989c27628c9037887df919561280519c
Patch-mainline: v3.9-rc5

This updates "include/linux/ceph/ceph_features.h" so all the feature
bits defined in the user space code are defined here.

The features supported by this implementation will still differ so
that's not updated here.
