Subject: [PATCH 14/54] aoe: update documentation with new URL and VM settings
	reference
To: Ann Davis <andavis@suse.com>
Cc: Swanand Rao <swrao@coraid.com>
Git-Commit: eecdf226721673095ef7849f960350897392e8bf
Patch-mainline: v3.7-rc1
References: FATE#314860 bnc#806858

The old area has a new URL.  Also, now that the driver can perform better,
it is worth mentioning the VM settings that help aoe to sink dirty pages
out early, avoiding unecessary memory pressure when much I/O is going on.
