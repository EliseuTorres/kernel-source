Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: fix block/biodoc.txt dma mapping description
Git-commit: c2282adbdea3548ae0271c1b1b2deec5f56ad224
References: FATE#311054
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.34

- It looks incorrect to use blk_rq_map_sg with pci_map_page here about
  DMA mappings. dma_map_sg?

- better to use dma_map_page instead of pci_map_page.
