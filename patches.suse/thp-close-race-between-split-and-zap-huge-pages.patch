Subject: [PATCH] thp: close race between split and zap huge pages

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: No (Expected 3.16)

Sasha Levin has reported two THP BUGs[1][2]. I believe both of them have
the same root cause. Let's look to them one by one.

The first bug[1] is "kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:1829!".
It's BUG_ON(mapcount != page_mapcount(page)) in __split_huge_page().
From my testing I see that page_mapcount() is higher than mapcount here.

I think it happens due to race between zap_huge_pmd() and
page_check_address_pmd(). page_check_address_pmd() misses PMD
which is under zap:

	CPU0						CPU1
						zap_huge_pmd()
						  pmdp_get_and_clear()
__split_huge_page()
  anon_vma_interval_tree_foreach()
    __split_huge_page_splitting()
      page_check_address_pmd()
        mm_find_pmd()
	  /*
	   * We check if PMD present without taking ptl: no
	   * serialization against zap_huge_pmd(). We miss this PMD,
	   * it's not accounted to 'mapcount' in __split_huge_page().
	   */
	  pmd_present(pmd) == 0

  BUG_ON(mapcount != page_mapcount(page)) // CRASH!!!

						  page_remove_rmap(page)
						    atomic_add_negative(-1, &page->_mapcount)

The second bug[2] is "kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:1371!".
It's VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!PageHead(page), page) in zap_huge_pmd().

This happens in similar way:

	CPU0						CPU1
						zap_huge_pmd()
						  pmdp_get_and_clear()
						  page_remove_rmap(page)
						    atomic_add_negative(-1, &page->_mapcount)
__split_huge_page()
  anon_vma_interval_tree_foreach()
    __split_huge_page_splitting()
      page_check_address_pmd()
        mm_find_pmd()
	  pmd_present(pmd) == 0	/* The same comment as above */
  /*
   * No crash this time since we already decremented page->_mapcount in
   * zap_huge_pmd().
   */
  BUG_ON(mapcount != page_mapcount(page))

  /*
   * We split the compound page here into small pages without
   * serialization against zap_huge_pmd()
   */
  __split_huge_page_refcount()
						VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!PageHead(page), page); // CRASH!!!

So my understanding the problem is pmd_present() check in mm_find_pmd()
without taking page table lock.

The bug was introduced by me commit with commit 117b0791ac42. Sorry for
that. :(

Let's open code mm_find_pmd() in page_check_address_pmd() and do the
check under page table lock.

Note that __page_check_address() does the same for PTE entires
if sync != 0.

I've stress tested split and zap code paths for 36+ hours by now and
don't see crashes with the patch applied. Before it took <20 min to
trigger the first bug and few hours for second one (if we ignore
first).
