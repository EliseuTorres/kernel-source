Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: make sure a bitmap has enough bytes

We have only been checking for min_bytes available in bitmap entries, but we
won't successfully setup a bitmap cluster unless it has at least bytes in the
bitmap, so in the common case min_bytes is 4k and we want something like 2MB, so
if there are a bunch of bitmap entries with less than 2mb's in them, we'll
search all them anyway, which is suboptimal.  Fix this check.  Thanks,
