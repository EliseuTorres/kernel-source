Subject: [PATCH] mm: migration: clarify migrate_pages() comment
References: Compaction/reclaim fixes (fate#311931)
Patch-mainline: yes (2.6.37)
Commit-ID: 28bd65781c848d95ba6a7f58b5c4b8265a804ec6

Callers of migrate_pages should putback_lru_pages to return pages
isolated to LRU or free list.  Now comment is rather confusing.  It says
caller always have to call it.

It is more clear to point out that the caller has to call it if
migrate_pages's return value isn't zero.
