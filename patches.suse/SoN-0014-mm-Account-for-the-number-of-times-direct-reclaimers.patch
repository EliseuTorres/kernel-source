Subject: mm: Account for the number of times direct reclaimers get throttled
References: Swap over NFS (fate#304949)
Patch-mainline: Not yet, merging efforts ongoing

Under significant pressure when writing back to network-backed storage,
direct reclaimers may get throttled. This is expected to be a
short-lived event and the processes get woken up again but processes do
get stalled. This patch counts how many times such stalling occurs. It's
up to the administrator whether to reduce these stalls by increasing
min_free_kbytes.
