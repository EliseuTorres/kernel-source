Subject: gfs2: allow spectator mounts for migration to ocfs2
Patch-mainline: never
References: FATE#307584

Lock out all writeable gfs2 mounts. This allows only spectator mounts, which
should never modify the disks. We do this to support minimal use of GFS2 for
migration of data. No performance bugs will be fixed. Any writeable mounts
are strictly prohibited.
