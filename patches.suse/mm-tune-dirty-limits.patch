Subject: [PATCH] mm: Make default VM dirty ratio configurable to suit different workloads
References: bnc#552883
Patch-mainline: Never

Based on the observation that higher VM dirty ratio improves performance of
most server workloads that dirties a lot of memory (e.g. simple databases not
using direct IO, workloads doing heavy writes) and the latency-sensitive
workloads like desktop and typical workstations perform better with a
decreased VM dirty ratio, make default VM dirty ratio configurable. This also
ensures that we have the similar dirty pages writeback limit in SLES11 SP1 as
compared to SLES11 GM.

The default VM dirty ratio is 20 for kernel-desktop flavor and 40 for all the
other flavors.

Also introduce a new CONFIG_KERNEL_DESKTOP option which might allow to tune
the kernel to suit desktop workloads.
