Subject: [PATCH] mm: compaction: Use synchronous compaction for /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory
References: Reduce major stalls due to THP and compaction
Patch-mainline: Yes (3.3)
Git-commit: b16d3d5a5219d01e9be5e586e5d50fbf1ca955ea

When asynchronous compaction was introduced, the
/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory handler should have been updated to always
use synchronous compaction. This did not happen so this patch addresses
it. The assumption is if a user writes to /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory,
they are willing for that process to stall.
