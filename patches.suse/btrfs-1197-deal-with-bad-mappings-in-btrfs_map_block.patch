Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: deal with bad mappings in btrfs_map_block

Martin Steigerwald reported a BUG_ON() in btrfs_map_block where we didn't find
a chunk for a particular block we were trying to map.  This happened because the
block was bogus.  We shouldn't be BUG_ON()'ing in this case, just print a
message and return an error.  This came from reada_add_block and it appears to
deal with an error fine so we should be good there.  Thanks,
