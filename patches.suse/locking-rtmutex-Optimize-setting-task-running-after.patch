Subject: [PATCH] locking/rtmutex: Optimize setting task running after being blocked
Git-commit: afffc6c1805d98e08e778cddb644a666e78cfcfd
Patch-mainline: v3.20-rc1
References: mutex scalability

We explicitly mark the task running after returning from
a __rt_mutex_slowlock() call, which does the actual sleeping
via wait-wake-trylocking. As such, this patch does two things:

(1) refactors the code so that setting current to TASK_RUNNING
    is done by __rt_mutex_slowlock(), and not by the callers. The
    downside to this is that it becomes a bit unclear when at what
    point we block. As such I've added a comment that the task
    blocks when calling __rt_mutex_slowlock() so readers can figure
    out when it is running again.

(2) relaxes setting current's state through __set_current_state(),
    instead of it's more expensive barrier alternative. There was no
    need for the implied barrier as we're obviously not planning on
    blocking.
