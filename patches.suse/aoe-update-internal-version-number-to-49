Subject: [PATCH 12/54] aoe: update internal version number to 49
To: Ann Davis <andavis@suse.com>
Cc: Swanand Rao <swrao@coraid.com>
Git-Commit: 7392fbe5ade3b28387bb467e39f5f3e01f6c9f13
Patch-mainline: v3.7-rc1
References: FATE#314860 bnc#806858

The internal version number of the aoe driver appears in a console message
when the driver loads and is usually obtained by the user with the
userland aoe-version tool, part of the aoetools.[1]

Although this patchset includes bugfixes backported from higher-numbered
versions published on the coraid.com website, it is a form of version 49.
