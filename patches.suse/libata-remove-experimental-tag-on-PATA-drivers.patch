Subject: [PATCH] libata: remove experimental tag on PATA drivers
Git-commit: 097dac91837b35947fffb0e303bcf71e4e4a789f
References: FATE#311054
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.33

Remove the experimental tag on Parallel ATA drivers. Though some of the
individual PATA drivers are still marked as experimental, as a group they can
hardly be considered to be, given they've been used in various distros for some
time.
