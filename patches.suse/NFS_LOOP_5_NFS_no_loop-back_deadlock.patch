Subject: [PATCH 5/5] NFS: avoid deadlocks with loop-back mounted NFS
 filesystems.
Patch-mainline: not yet
References: fate#315220

Support for loop-back mounted NFS filesystems is useful when NFS is
used to access shared storage in a high-availability cluster.

If the node running the NFS server fails some other node can mount the
filesystem and start providing NFS service.  If that node already had
the filesystem NFS mounted, it will now have it loop-back mounted.

nfsd can suffer a deadlock when allocating memory and entering direct
reclaim.
While direct reclaim does not write to the NFS filesystem it can send
and wait for a COMMIT through nfs_release_page().

This patch modifies nfs_release_page() and the functions it calls so
that if the COMMIT is sent to the local host (i.e. is routed over the
loop-back interface) then nfs_release_page() will not wait forever for
that COMMIT to complete.

Aborting early should be safe as kswapd uses the same code but never
waits for the COMMIT.

Always aborting early could upset the balance of memory management so
when the commit was sent to the local host we still wait but with a
100ms timeout.  This is enough to significantly slow down any process
that is allocating lots of memory and often long enough to let the
commit complete.

In those rare cases where it is nfsd, or something that nfsd is
waiting for, that is calling nfs_release_page(), 100ms is not so long
that throughput will be affected.

When fail-over happens a remote (foreign) client will first become
disconnected and then turn into a local client.
To prevent deadlocks from happening at this point, we still have a
timeout when the COMMIT has been sent to a remote client. In this case
the timeout is longer (1 second).

So when a node that has mounted a remote filesystem loses the
connection, nfs_release_page() will stop blocking and start failing.
Memory allocators will then be able to make progress without blocking
in NFS.  Any process which writes to a file will still be blocked in
balance_dirty_pages().

I really need a version of wait_on_bit and friends which supports
timeouts for this patch.  I've hacked something that works by abusing
current->journal_info, but I don't expect that to go upstream.

I cannot simply use schedule_timeout in the wait_bit function as there
could be false wakeups due to hash collisions in bit_waitqueue().
One possibility would to be to have a 'private' field in 'struct
wait_bit_key' that was initialized to 0, and have the address of
that struct passed to the 'action' function.
There are currently 26 of these action functions so it wouldn't be too
hard to change the interface...
