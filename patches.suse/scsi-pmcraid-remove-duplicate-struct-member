Subject: [SCSI] pmcraid: remove duplicate struct member
Patch-mainline: v2.6.37-rc1
Git-commit: df30e5059681ed0671c9cc6ff702fe9ca7f20042

sense_buffer is both a direct member of struct pmcraid_cmd as well as
an indirect one via an anonymous union and struct.  Fix this clash by
eliminating the direct member in favour of the anonymous struct/union
one.  The name duplication apparently isn't noticed by gcc versions
earlier than 4.4
