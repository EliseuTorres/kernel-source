Subject: kgr: fix race of stub and patching
Patch-mainline: submitted for review
References: fate#313296

While we are patching, we set up a stub which refers to
kgr_in_progress of a process. The stub can be called immediately when
set up, but we set the flag even after done with patching in
kgr_handle_processes. This is obviously too late, so set the flag
before we start patching, but after we check that no other patching is
in progress -- we would interfere otherwise.
