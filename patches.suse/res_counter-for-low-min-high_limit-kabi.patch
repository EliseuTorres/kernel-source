Subject: res_counter: add placeholders for min/low/high limits
Patch-mainline: never, res_counter was removed upstream
References: fate#312101

New approach for memory isolations via memory cgroup controller will introduce
new min/low/high limits for resource counters.

This structure shouldn't be critical but make sure we have room in it just in
case it is inlined somewhere at an unexpected place.
