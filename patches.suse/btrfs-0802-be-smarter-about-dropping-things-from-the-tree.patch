Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: be smarter about dropping things from the
 tree log

When we truncate existing items in the tree log we've been searching for
each individual item and removing them.  This is unnecessary churn and
searching, just keep track of the slot we are on and how many items we need
to delete and delete them all at once.  Thanks,
