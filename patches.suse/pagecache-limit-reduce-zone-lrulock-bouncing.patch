Subject: pagecachelimit: reduce lru_lock contention for heavy parallel reclaim
Patch-mainline: never
References: bnc#878509, bnc#864464

More customers have started complaining about hard lockups detected during
heavy pageche limit reclaim. 

All the collected vmcore files shown us the same class of problem. There is no
hard lockup in the system. It is just irq aware lru_lock bouncing all over the
place like crazy. There were many CPUs fighting over the single zone's lru_lock
to isolate some pages + some other lru_lock users who try to free memory as a
result of munmap or exit.

All those systems were configured to use 4G page_cache although the machine was
equipped with much more memory.  pagecache_over_limit tries to be clever and
relax the limit a bit but 4G on 1TB machine still sounds like a too low and
increases the risk of parallel page cache reclaim. If we add NUMA effects and
hundreds of CPUs then the lock bouncing is simply unavoidable problem.

This patch addresses the problem by reducing the contention of the page cache
reclaimers by definition. Only one such reclaimer is allowed to scan one zone.
shrink_all_zones which is used only by the pagecache reclaim iterates over all
available zones. We have added a per-zone atomic counter and use it as a lock
(we cannot use the spinlock because reclaim is a sleepable context and mutex
sounds too heavy).

Only one reclaimer is allowed to lock to the zone and try to reclaim it.
Others will back off to other currently unlocked zones. If all the zones are
locked for a reclaimer it is put into a sleep on pagecache_reclaim_wq
waitqueue which is woken up after any of the current reclaimers is done
with the work. Sleeper retries __shrink_page_cache along with re-evaluating
page cache limit and attempt the new round only if it is still applicable.

This patch potentially breaks kABI on some architectures but x86_64 should be
safe because it is put before padding and after 3 ints so there should be 32b
available even without the padding. If other architectures have a problem with
that we can use suse_kabi_padding at the end of the structure.
This will be sorted out before the patch gets merged into our tree.
