Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: wake up transaction thread from SYNC_FS ioctl

The transaction thread may want to do more work, namely it pokes the
cleaner ktread that will start processing uncleaned subvols.

This can be triggered by user via the 'btrfs fi sync' command, otherwise
there was a delay up to 30 seconds before the cleaner started to clean
old snapshots.
