Subject: [PATCH] mm: close PageTail race

References: VM Functionality
Patch-mainline: Yes (3.14)
Git-commit: 668f9abbd4334e6c29fa8acd71635c4f9101caa7

Since "mm, compaction: avoid isolating pinned pages", it has been
possible for page_count(page) to race with prep_compound_page() by
finding PageTail(page) set with a NULL or dangling page->first_page.

"mm, page_alloc: make first_page visible before PageTail" adds a store
memory barrier to prep_compound_page() to ensure page->first_page is
set, but nothing is preventing compound_head() from seeing a dangling
head page.

This patch uses Andrea's implementation of compound_trans_head() that
deals with such a race and makes it the default compound_head()
implementation.  This includes a read memory barrier that ensures that
if PageTail(head) is true that we return a head page that is neither
NULL nor dangling.

This is the safest way to ensure we see the head page that we are
expecting, PageTail(page) is already in the unlikely() path and the
memory barriers are unfortunately required.

Hugetlbfs is the exception, we don't enforce a store memory barrier
during init since no race is possible.
