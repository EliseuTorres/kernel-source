Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix a scrub regression in case of write errors

This regression was introduced by the device-replace patches.
Scrub immediately stops checking those disks that have write errors.
This is nothing that happens in the real world, but it is wrong
since scrub is the tool to detect and repair defects. Fix it.
