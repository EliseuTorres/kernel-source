Subject: mm: compaction: reset cached scanner pfn's before reading them
Git-commit: d3132e4b83e6bd383c74d716f7281d7c3136089c
Patch-mainline: Yes (v3.14)
References: VM Functionality

Compaction caches pfn's for its migrate and free scanners to avoid
scanning the whole zone each time.  In compact_zone(), the cached values
are read to set up initial values for the scanners.  There are several
situations when these cached pfn's are reset to the first and last pfn
of the zone, respectively.  One of these situations is when a compaction
has been deferred for a zone and is now being restarted during a direct
compaction, which is also done in compact_zone().

However, compact_zone() currently reads the cached pfn's *before*
resetting them.  This means the reset doesn't affect the compaction that
performs it, and with good chance also subsequent compactions, as
update_pageblock_skip() is likely to be called and update the cached
pfn's to those being processed.  Another chance for a successful reset
is when a direct compaction detects that migration and free scanners
meet (which has its own problems addressed by another patch) and sets
update_pageblock_skip flag which kswapd uses to do the reset because it
goes to sleep.

This is clearly a bug that results in non-deterministic behavior, so
this patch moves the cached pfn reset to be performed *before* the
values are read.
