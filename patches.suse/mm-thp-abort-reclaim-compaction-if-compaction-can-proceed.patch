Subject: [PATCH] mm: Abort reclaim/compaction if compaction can proceed
References: Reclaim/compaction (fate#311931)
Patch-mainline: yes
Git-commit: e0c23279c9f800c403f37511484d9014ac83adec

If compaction can proceed, shrink_zones() stops doing any work but its
callers still call shrink_slab() which raises the priority and potentially
sleeps.  This is unnecessary and wasteful so this patch aborts direct
reclaim/compaction entirely if compaction can proceed.
