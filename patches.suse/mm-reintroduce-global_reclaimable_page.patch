Subject: mm: reintroduce global_reclaimable_page
Patch-mainline: never
References: FATE309111

This reverts parts of commit 414f6b9f9fa13c636c7dc136f958cd1911fa62d0
(mm/page-writeback.c: do not count anon pages as dirtyable memory)
from 3.12.11, upstream commit a1c3bfb2f67ef766de03f1f56bdfff9c859. It
removed global_reclaimable_page function which we call from our
"Patch-mainline: never" patch:
patches.suse/pagecache-limit.patch

So add it back and mark it as deprecated for later evaluation. It is
too late to change the behavior now.

mhocko comments:
Although using NR_{IN}ACTIVE_FILE should be OK here, let's stick with
the old behavior and change it later.
