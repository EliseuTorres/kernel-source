Subject: [PATCH] [SCSI] Unexport scsi/scsi.h from headers_install
X-Git: 7407e5bba2cc821950344fd1391d9ad1b7e0b397
References: FATE#311692
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.34

The scsi/scsi.h header is normally provided by the libc (and was not
exported by the kernel since 2.6.24) and has been until it was
re-exported with 2.6.31.  The kernel version is not userspace clean and
does not appear to provide anything useable in userland over the
(e)glibc version.
