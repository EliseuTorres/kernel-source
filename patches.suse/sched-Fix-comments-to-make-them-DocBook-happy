Subject: sched: Fix comments to make them DocBook happy
From: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
Date: Thu Jun 10 12:06:21 2010 +1000
Git-commit: b6b12294405e6ec029e627c49adf3193829a2685
References:

Docbook fails in sched_fair.c due to comments added in the asymmetric
packing patch series.

This fixes these errors. No code changes.
