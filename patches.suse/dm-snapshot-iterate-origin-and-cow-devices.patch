Subject: [PATCH] dm snapshot: iterate origin and cow devices
X-Git: 1e5554c8428bc7209a83e2d07ca724be4d981ce3
References: FATE#311692
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.34

Iterate both origin and snapshot devices

iterate_devices method should call the callback for all the devices where
the bio may be remapped. Thus, snapshot_iterate_devices should call the callback
for both snapshot and origin underlying devices because it remaps some bios
to the snapshot and some to the origin.

snapshot_iterate_devices called the callback only for the origin device.
This led to badly calculated device limits if snapshot and origin were placed
on different types of disks.
