Subject: [PATCH 007/027] x86, boot: Remove misc.h inclusion from compressed/string.c

Git-commit: a9a17104a112a67a7bf0679b734704c130eb5faa
Patch-mainline: v3.16-rc1
Reference: fate#315018
Target: sle12-sp1

Given the fact that we removed inclusion of boot.h from boot/string.c
does not look like we need misc.h inclusion in compressed/string.c. So
remove it.

misc.h was also pulling in string_32.h which in turn had macros for
memcmp and memcpy. So we don't need to #undef memcmp and memcpy anymore.
