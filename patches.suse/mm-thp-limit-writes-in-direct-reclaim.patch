Subject: [PATCH] mm: Limit the amount of writing in direct reclaim for THP
References: Reduce major stalls due to THP and compaction
Patch-mainline: no

THP writes too much and while there is a series that eliminates writes, it
is very far reaching and not heavily tested enough. This patch limits some
of the writes without being too complex until the full series is baked.
