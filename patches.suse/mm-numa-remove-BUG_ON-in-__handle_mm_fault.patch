Subject: [PATCH] mm,numa: remove BUG_ON in __handle_mm_fault

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: No (Expected v3.16)

Changing PTEs and PMDs to pte_numa & pmd_numa is done with the
mmap_sem held for reading, which means a pmd can be instantiated
and/or turned into a numa one while __handle_mm_fault is examining
the value of orig_pmd.

If that happens, __handle_mm_fault should just return and let
the page fault retry, instead of throwing an oops.
