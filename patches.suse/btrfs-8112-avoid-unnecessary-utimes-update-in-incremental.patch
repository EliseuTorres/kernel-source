Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: avoid unnecessary utimes update in incremental send

When we're finishing processing of an inode, if we're dealing with a
directory inode that has a pending move/rename operation, we don't
need to send a utimes update instruction to the send stream, as we'll
do it later after doing the move/rename operation. Therefore we save
some time here building paths and doing btree lookups.
