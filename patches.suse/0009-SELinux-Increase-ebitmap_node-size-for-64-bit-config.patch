Subject: SELinux: Increase ebitmap_node size for 64-bit configuration
Git-commit: a767f680e34bf14a36fefbbb6d85783eef99fd57
Patch-mainline: v3.13-rc4
References: FATE#317271

Currently, the ebitmap_node structure has a fixed size of 32 bytes. On
a 32-bit system, the overhead is 8 bytes, leaving 24 bytes for being
used as bitmaps. The overhead ratio is 1/4.

On a 64-bit system, the overhead is 16 bytes. Therefore, only 16 bytes
are left for bitmap purpose and the overhead ratio is 1/2. With a
3.8.2 kernel, a boot-up operation will cause the ebitmap_get_bit()
function to be called about 9 million times. The average number of
ebitmap_node traversal is about 3.7.

This patch increases the size of the ebitmap_node structure to 64
bytes for 64-bit system to keep the overhead ratio at 1/4. This may
also improve performance a little bit by making node to node traversal
less frequent (< 2) as more bits are available in each node.

This patch is based on the following 3.13 commit:
