Subject: [PATCH] vmscan: add customisable shrinker batch size
References: Reduce excessive slab shrinking due to GFP_NOFS failures
Patch-mainline: Yes (v3.1-rc1)
Git-commit: e9299f5058595a655c3b207cda9635e28b9197e6

For shrinkers that have their own cond_resched* calls, having
shrink_slab break the work down into small batches is not
paticularly efficient. Add a custom batchsize field to the struct
shrinker so that shrinkers can use a larger batch size if they
desire.

A value of zero (uninitialised) means "use the default", so
behaviour is unchanged by this patch.
