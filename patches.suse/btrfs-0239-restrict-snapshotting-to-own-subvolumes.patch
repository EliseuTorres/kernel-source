Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: restrict snapshotting to own subvolumes

Currently, any user can snapshot any subvolume if the path is accessible and
thus indirectly create and keep files he does not own under his direcotries.
This is not possible with traditional directories.

In security context, a user can snapshot root filesystem and pin any
potentially buggy binaries, even if the updates are applied.

All the snapshots are visible to the administrator, so it's possible to
verify if there are suspicious snapshots.

Another more practical problem is that any user can pin the space used
by eg. root and cause ENOSPC.
