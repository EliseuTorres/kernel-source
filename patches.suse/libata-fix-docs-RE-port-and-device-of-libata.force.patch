Subject: [PATCH] libata: fix docs, RE port and device of libata.force ID separated by point
Git-commit: 4c44f309cd396c18b096d31f03126824c685dbe2
References: FATE#311692
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.34

According to libata-core correctly around line 6572:

	/* parse id */
	p = strchr(id, '.');
	...

the optional device is separated from the port in the libata.force ID
by a point or dot instead of by a colon.

Fix documentation to reflect this.
