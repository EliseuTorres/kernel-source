Subject: Xen: improve floppy behavior

References: bnc#584216

Timing is significantly different from native both because Xen traps
I/O port accesses and using DMA not being possible (without intrusive
changes). Due to the overhead of trapped port accesses, I/O is already
slow enough (and Xen doesn't run on very old hardware anyway), so the
situation can easily be improved by not enforcing REALLY_SLOW_IO.

This doesn't completely address the issue - Xen just cannot guarantee
scheduling of a particular vCPU with a maximum latency of about 80us
(needed for the default FIFO threshold value of 10). The only complete
solution would require making ISA DMA usable on Xen.
