Subject: dasd: re-prioritize partition detection message
Patch-mainline: yes
References: bnc#764091,LTC#81617

Symptom:     Some monitoring tools are unnecessarily alerted by the
             warning message "Warning, expected label VOL1 not found, 
             treating as CDL formated disk".
Problem:     The message is printed as warning every time a DASD is getting
             formatted.
Solution:    Change the priority from WARNING to INFO and remove the word 
             "Warning".
