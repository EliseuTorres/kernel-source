Subject: FADT: Remove extraneous warning for very large GPE registers.
References: bnc#811088
Git-commit: 6d1490e248190646773083df60b25ffe14f74a4b

This change removes a size mismatch warning if the legacy length
field for a GPE register set is larger than the 64-bit GAS structure
can accomodate. GPE register sets can be larger than the 255 bit limitation
of the GAS structure. Linn Crosetto (linn@hp.com).
