Description:  qeth: don't query for info if hardware not ready.
Symptom:      Under certain timing when networking is quickly turned
              off and on, there is this error:
              qeth.3acf0c: 0.0.e101: The qeth device driver failed to
                 recover an error on the device
              and the script gets hang for some time.
Problem:      When qeth device recovery is triggered while networking
              setup script is running, `ethtool` kernel interface can
              be accessed when the card is offline. Executing the
              hardware operation to read the card status at this moment
              is not allowed and may cause problems.
Solution:     Check if the card is online, and if it is not, do not
              call qeth_query_card_info(), and return -ENODEV (for
              compatibility with other similar cases).
Reproduction: The problem can be reproduced (not reliably) on systems
              that run wickedd for network management, by configuring
              several qeth interfaces, single CPU, and turning
              wickedd service off and on repeatedly in a script.
