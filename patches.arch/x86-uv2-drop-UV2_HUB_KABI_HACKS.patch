Subject: x86 / UV2: Drop the unnecessary definition of UV2_HUB_KABI_HACKS
Patch-mainline: No
References: bnc#722795

The definition of UV2_HUB_KABI_HACKS is not necessary any more and it
had been removed once already by one of the previous UV2 patches, but
that patch was then dropped after one of the -stable updates.  Still,
the -stable update didn't remove UV2_HUB_KABI_HACKS, so it reappeared
causing some confusion to happen.  Remove it again.
