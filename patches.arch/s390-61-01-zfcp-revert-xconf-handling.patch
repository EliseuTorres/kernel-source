Subject: zfcp: fix adapter (re)open recovery while link to SAN is down
From: Daniel Hansel <daniel.hansel@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
Patch-mainline: Submitted
References: bnc#789010,LTC#86283

Symptom:      FCP device remains in status ERP_FAILED when device is
              switched online or adapter recovery is triggered while
              link to SAN is down.
Problem:      When Exchange Configuration Data command returns the FSF
              status FSF_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA_INCOMPLETE it aborts the
              exchange process. The only retries are done during the
              common error recovery procedure (i.e. max. 3 retries
              with 8sec sleep between) and remains in status
              ERP_FAILED with QDIO down.
Solution:     This commit reverts the commit
              0df138476c8306478d6e726f044868b4bccf411c (zfcp: Fix
              adapter activation on link down). When FSF status
              FSF_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA_INCOMPLETE is received the
              adapter recovery will be finished without any retries.
              QDIO will be up now and status changes such as LINK UP
              will be received now.
Reproduction: When FCP device is online pull the cable and trigger the
              adapter recovery manually (i.e. "echo 0 > failed").
              Alternatively set the FCP device to offline state. Then
              pull the cable and set the FCP back to online state.
              After a time of 24 seconds (3 retries with 8s sleep) the
              adapter recovery gives up and the FCP device remains in
              status ERP_FAILED even if the cable is plugged in again.
