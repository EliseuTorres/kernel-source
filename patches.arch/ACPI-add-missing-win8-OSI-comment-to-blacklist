Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: add missing win8 OSI comment to blacklist
Git-commit: 068aab7766cf968a8ddb86a6d7c6bbed9d61e353
Patch-mainline: 3.13-rc1
References: bnc#856294

In my original patch[1] I wrote a comment describing the reason for
disabling Windows 2012 OSI mode for a group of machines, however, due to
unknown reasons (probably a conflict resolution mismatch), the comment
was dropped in 94fb982 (ACPI: blacklist win8 OSI for buggy laptops).

Since Matthew Garrett is making a big deal out of the lack of comments
in a separate patch[2], it might make sense to re-introduce the missing
comment so that other patch is not blocked and users don't suffer.
