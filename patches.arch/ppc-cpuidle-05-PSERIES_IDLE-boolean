Subject: powerpc/cpuidle: Make it a bool, not a tristate
Git-commit: f7aa554510f8ff4b1411c31332713ccd8c244ace
Patch-mainline: yes
References: fate#314019,bnc#795230

    As pointed out, asm/system.h has empty inline implementations for
    update_smt_snooze_delay and pseries_notify_cpuidle_add_cpu, which are
    used when CONFIG_PSERIES_IDLE is undefined. Since those two functions
    are used in core power architecture functions (store_smt_snooze_delay
    at kernel/sysfs.c and smp_xics_setup_cpu at platforms/pseries/smp.c),
