Subject: KVM: nVMX: Additional TSC-offset handling
References: fate#314655
Patch-mainline: v3.1
Git-commit: 7991825b8558a719eb7cfb93c4458d767ae1f2eb

In the unlikely case that L1 does not capture MSR_IA32_TSC, L0 needs to
emulate this MSR write by L2 by modifying vmcs02.tsc_offset. We also need to
set vmcs12.tsc_offset, for this change to survive the next nested entry (see
prepare_vmcs02()).
Additionally, we also need to modify vmx_adjust_tsc_offset: The semantics
of this function is that the TSC of all guests on this vcpu, L1 and possibly
several L2s, need to be adjusted. To do this, we need to adjust vmcs01's
tsc_offset (this offset will also apply to each L2s we enter). We can't set
vmcs01 now, so we have to remember this adjustment and apply it when we
later exit to L1.
