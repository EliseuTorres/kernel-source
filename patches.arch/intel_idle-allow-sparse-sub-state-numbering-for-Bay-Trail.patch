Subject: intel_idle: allow sparse sub-state numbering, for Bay Trail
Patch-mainline: Upstream/v3.15-rc1
Git-commit: 24bfa950f114d5d770e482de73cf673a3b017f65
Git-repo: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel

Like acpi_idle, intel_idle compared sub-state numbers
to the number of supported sub-states -- discarding
sub-states numbers that were numbered >= the number of states.

But some Bay Trail SOCs use sparse sub-state numbers,
so we can't make such a comparison if we are going
to access those states.

So now we simply check that _some_ sub-states are
supported for the given state, and assume that the
sub-state number in our driver is valid.

In practice, the driver is correct, and even if it were not,
the hardware clips invalid sub-state requests to valid ones.

No entries in the driver require this change,
but Bay Trail will need it.
