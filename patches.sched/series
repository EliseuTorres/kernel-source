	# FATE scheduler updates, insert immediately after Scheduler / Core
	# these patches bring the scheduler core essentially to 2.6.40 merge window,
	# picking up hotplug, load balancing, sched domain construction rewrite,
	# NOHZ switch to push model, cgroups scalalility improvements, a few generic
	# fixes, and cleanups along the way to smooth the path forward.
