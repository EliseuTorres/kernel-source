Subject: KABI: fix up struct hrtimer_cpu_base change

struct hrtimer_cpu_base changed in 2.6.32.11 and we want these changes
(they fix some issues with guest oses, see commit
41d2e494937715d3150e5c75d01f0e75ae899337 upstream for details), and this
structure is only used as an opaque pointer within all external
structures and calls, so lets just make the KABI checker think that
nothing has happened here and all is well.
