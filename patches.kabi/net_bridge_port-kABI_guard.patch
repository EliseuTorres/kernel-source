Subject: net_bridge_port kABI guard
From: Mike Galbraith <mgalbraith@suse.de>
Patch-mainline: never

designated_age was added into net_bridge_port struct in 2.6.32.44 by
90d769e3203 (0c03150e7ea upstream). But this is only used internally
by the bridge code. So we can use old bad __GENKSYMS__ hack to avoid
kabi error.
