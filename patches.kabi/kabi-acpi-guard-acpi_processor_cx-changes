Subject: KABI: acpi: Guard acpi_processor_cx changes
Patch-mainline: Never

 2.6.32.2 added the acpi_processor_cx->bm_sts_skip to the middle
 of the structure. It's only used during boot and external modules
 shouldn't be messing with it.

 This patch moves it to the end of the structure and guards it.
