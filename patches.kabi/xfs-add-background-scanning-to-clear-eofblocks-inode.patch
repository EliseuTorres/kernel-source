Subject: kABI fixup for "[PATCH] xfs: add background scanning to clear eofblocks inodes"
Patch-mainline: never
References: bnc#930788

This patch is being pulled from SP3, where much larger section of struct xfs_mount
has been protected, including these three fields (protection for other fields
has been removed while SP4 kABI has been still in flux).
