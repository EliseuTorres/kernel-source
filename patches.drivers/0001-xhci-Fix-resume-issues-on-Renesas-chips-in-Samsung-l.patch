Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Fix resume issues on Renesas chips in Samsung laptops

Don Zickus <dzickus@redhat.com> writes:

Some co-workers of mine bought Samsung laptops that had mostly usb3 ports.
Those ports did not resume correctly (the driver would timeout communicating
and fail).  This led to frustration as suspend/resume is a common use for
laptops.

Poking around, I applied the reset on resume quirk to this chipset and the
resume started working.  Reloading the xhci_hcd module had been the temporary
workaround.
