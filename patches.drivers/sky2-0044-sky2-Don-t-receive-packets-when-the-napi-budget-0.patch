Subject: [PATCH 44/49] sky2: Don't receive packets when the napi budget == 0
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
Git-commit: 21ceda26d7418c688dd9186eb46a49c4c0887e61
References: bsc#909566 FATE#314306

Processing any incoming packets with a with a napi budget of 0
is incorrect driver behavior.

This matters as netpoll will shortly call drivers with a budget of 0
to avoid receive packet processing happening in hard irq context.
