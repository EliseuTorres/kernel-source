Subject: USB: Add stream ID field to struct urb.
Patch-mainline: v2.6.35
Git-commit: 94af1220985c71cd80d6c161b7a42c51ef08b923

Bulk endpoint streams were added in the USB 3.0 specification.  Streams
allow a device driver to overload a bulk endpoint so that multiple
transfers can be queued at once.

Add a new field, stream_id, to struct urb so that USB 3.0 drivers can
specify which stream they want the URB to be queued to.
