Subject: net/mlx4_core: Fix wrong dump of the vxlan offloads device capability
Patch-mainline: v3.14-rc7
Git-commit: 56cb456746a15c1025a178466492ca4c373b1a63
References: bug#919382 FATE#317529

Fix the value used to dump the vxlan offloads device capability to align
with the MLX4_DEV_CAP_FLAG2_yyy definition. While on that, add dump to
the IPoIB flow-steering device capability and fix small typo.

The vxlan cap value wasn't fully handled when a conflict was resolved
between MLX4_DEV_CAP_FLAG2_DMFS_IPOIB coming from the IB tree to
MLX4_DEV_CAP_FLAG2_VXLAN_OFFLOADS coming from net-next.
