Subject: [PATCH] disable catas_reset by default to avoid problems with EEH
References: bnc#456389

PPC machines with EEH and Mellanox ib/net cards with catastrophic error
recovery that encounter a PCI bus error can crash and become
unresponsive.

Disable the card reset to avoid this. 

NOTE: an upstream fix will come later once IBM can review a couple of
approaches I suggested since this fix is brute force. This driver didn't have
this reset on error feature in SLES10 so it isn't a feature removal.
