Subject: [PATCH 202/227] ethernet: codespell comment spelling fixes
Patch-mainline: v4.1-rc1
Git-commit: dbedd44e982d61c156337b1a3fb252b24085f8e3 (partial)
References: bsc#922853 FATE#318529

To test a checkpatch spelling patch, I ran codespell against
drivers/net/ethernet/.

$ git ls-files drivers/net/ethernet/ | \
  while read file ; do \
    codespell -w $file; \
  done

I removed a false positive in e1000_hw.h
