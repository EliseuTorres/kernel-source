Subject: [PATCH 050/194] tg3: Add 5784 ASIC rev to earlier PCIe MPS fix
Git-commit: 6de34cb963a934953fdd365937b4b75959256602
Patch-mainline: v2.6.36-rc1
References: bnc#697783, FATE#311457

tg3 commit e7126997342560533317d8467e8516119ebcbd21 entitled
"tg3: Preserve PCIe MPS setting for new devs" attempted to ensure the
PCIe link negotiated Maximum Payload Size (MPS) setting was 128 bytes
for all devices that didn't support higher speeds.  The 5784 device was
mistakenly added to this list when it shouldn't have.  This patch
removes the 5784 ASIC rev devices from that list.
