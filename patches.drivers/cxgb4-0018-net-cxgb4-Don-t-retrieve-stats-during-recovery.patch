Subject: [PATCH 18/19] net/cxgb4: Don't retrieve stats during recovery
Patch-mainline: v3.14-rc1
Git-commit: 9fe6cb58378c3b8535e00dab7195b5d35defa17a
References: bnc#863619 FATE#315951

We possibly retrieve the adapter's statistics during EEH recovery
and that should be disallowed. Otherwise, it would possibly incur
replicate EEH error and EEH recovery is going to fail eventually.

The patch reuses statistics lock and checks net_device is attached
before going to retrieve statistics, so that the problem can be
avoided.
