Subject: mmc: Fix re-probing after hibernation
Patch-mainline: v2.6.37-rc8
References: bnc#646702
Git-commit: 274476f8fe0b6ac9bac542cc39de12c3dd0f43f6

The commit 4c2ef25fe0b847d2ae818f74758ddb0be1c27d8e
  mmc: fix all hangs related to mmc/sd card insert/removal during
  suspend/resume
introduced a bug where the device probing no longer works after
hibernation.  This was because the pm notifier expects
PM_POST_HIBERNATION call while the system sends PM_POST_RESTORE
instead, thus disable_rescan is kept as 1.
