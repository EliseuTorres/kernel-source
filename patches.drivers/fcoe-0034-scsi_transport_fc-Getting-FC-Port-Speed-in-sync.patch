Subject: [SCSI] scsi_transport_fc: Getting FC Port Speed in sync with FC-GS
Git-commit: a9277e7783651d4e0a849f7988340b1c1cf748a4
References: FATE#313793
Patch-Mainline: v3.4

The values for the 4G and 10G speeds are not in sync with
definitions in SM-HBA/FC-GS-x/etc.
This patch brings them in sync to these specifications.

The values are converted to strings when represented via
sysfs attribute, hence that should cover for user space
apps as they may not see any change.
