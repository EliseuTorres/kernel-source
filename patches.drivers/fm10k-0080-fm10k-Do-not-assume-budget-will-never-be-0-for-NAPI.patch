Subject: [PATCH 80/97] fm10k: Do not assume budget will never be 0 for NAPI
Patch-mainline: v4.1-rc4
Git-commit: 59486329b46f31532ab032014fbaae72e9f190c3
References: bsc#922855 FATE#318530

The netpoll path will call napi->poll with a budget of 0 in order to clean
the Tx rings only.  This change updates the fm10k driver so that it will
correctly support that instead of cleaning 1 Rx frame if a budget of 0 is
received.
