Subject: [PATCH 208/242] bnx2x: Don't receive packets when the napi budget ==
 0
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1

Git-commit: b3529744b412e9870c9e10fef874e3bee2af1afa
References: bsc#908684 FATE#317539


Processing any incoming packets with a with a napi budget of 0
is incorrect driver behavior.

This matters as netpoll will shortly call drivers with a budget of 0
to avoid receive packet processing happening in hard irq context.
