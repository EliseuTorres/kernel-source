Subject: [PATCH 10/77] igb: remove references to long gone command line
 parameters
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
Git-commit: 406d49656f80b1e6d37d67e187a640243ed87ba9
References: bsc#922836 Fate#318523

Command line parameters QueuePairs, Node, EEE, DMAC and InterruptThrottleRate
do not exist these days. Remove all references to them in the Documentation
folder and update code comments.

 This parameter adds support for SR-IOV.  It causes the driver to spawn up to
 max_vfs worth of virtual function.
 
-QueuePairs
-----------
-Valid Range:  0-1
-Default Value:  1 (TX and RX will be paired onto one interrupt vector)
-
-If set to 0, when MSI-X is enabled, the TX and RX will attempt to occupy
-separate vectors.
-
-This option can be overridden to 1 if there are not sufficient interrupts
-available.  This can occur if any combination of RSS, VMDQ, and max_vfs
-results in more than 4 queues being used.
-
-Node
-----
-Valid Range:   0-n
-Default Value: -1 (off)
-
-  0 - n: where n is the number of the NUMA node that should be used to
-         allocate memory for this adapter port.
-  -1: uses the driver default of allocating memory on whichever processor is
-      running insmod/modprobe.
-
-  The Node parameter will allow you to pick which NUMA node you want to have
-  the adapter allocate memory from.  All driver structures, in-memory queues,
-  and receive buffers will be allocated on the node specified.  This parameter
-  is only useful when interrupt affinity is specified, otherwise some portion
-  of the time the interrupt could run on a different core than the memory is
-  allocated on, causing slower memory access and impacting throughput, CPU, or
-  both.
-
-EEE
----
-Valid Range:  0-1
-Default Value: 1 (enabled)
-
-  A link between two EEE-compliant devices will result in periodic bursts of
-  data followed by long periods where in the link is in an idle state. This Low
-  Power Idle (LPI) state is supported in both 1Gbps and 100Mbps link speeds.
-  NOTE: EEE support requires autonegotiation.
-
-DMAC
-----
-Valid Range: 0-1
-Default Value: 1 (enabled)
-  Enables or disables DMA Coalescing feature.
