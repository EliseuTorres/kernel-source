Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Fix inconsistent mic-mute LED
Patch-mainline: Never; fixed differently in upstream
References: bnc#848864

The mic mute LED might be shown inconsistently in some situations.
The fix is to update the GPIO bit always in the put callback.

This patch is SLE-only, as the issue doesn't exist in the upstream
any longer, as the code there has been rewritten completely.
