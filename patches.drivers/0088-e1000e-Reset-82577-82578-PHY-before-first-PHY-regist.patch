Subject: e1000e: Reset 82577/82578 PHY before first PHY register read
References: bnc#699092, fate#311825
Patch-mainline: v2.6.35
Git-commit: 627c8a041f7aaaea93c766f69bd61d952a277586

Reset the PHY before first accessing it.  Doing so, ensure that the PHY is
in a known good state before we read/write PHY registers. This fixes a
driver probe failure.
