Subject: NVMe: Correctly handle IOCTL_SUBMIT_IO when cpus > online queues
References: bnc#936076,FATE#318544
Patch-Mainline: v3.20
Git-commit: 5905535610fc6b11379a999ff45bfa39f0d605b6

nvme_submit_io_cmd() uses smp_processor_id() to pick an IO queue index.
This patch fixes the case where there are more cpus from which the ioctl
call can originate than online queues, which can happen when a device
supports or was allocated fewer interrupt vectors than exist cpu cores.

Thanks to Keith Busch for the implementation suggestion.
