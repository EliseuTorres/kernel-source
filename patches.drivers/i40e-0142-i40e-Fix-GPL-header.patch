Subject: [PATCH 142/188] i40e: Fix GPL header
Patch-mainline: v3.14-rc1
Git-commit: dc641b7319f19a17639ed7d36aaddbf090206644
References: bnc#857397 FATE#315659

The GPL header included in each file in the i40e driver doesn't
need to include the "this program" text since this driver
is already part of the larger kernel.
