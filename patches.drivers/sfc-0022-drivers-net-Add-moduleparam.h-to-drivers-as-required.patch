Subject: [PATCH v2 022/244] drivers/net: Add moduleparam.h to drivers as
 required.
Patch-mainline: v3.2-rc1
Git-commit: 6eb07caf1ac5723720caea2ee93cd11b7058a0aa (partial)
References: bsc#909618 FATE#317521

These files were using moduleparam infrastructure, but were not
including anything for it -- which is fine when module.h is being
implicitly included in all files, but that is going away.
