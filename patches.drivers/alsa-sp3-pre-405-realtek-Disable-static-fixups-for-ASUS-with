Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek - Disable static fixups for ASUS with ALC269
Git-commit: a7f3eedc88b547e0ec35ba4cc4ae61cd9bc760ac
Patch-mainline: 3.4-rc3

We've enabled the static fixups for ASUS machines with ALC269 codec,
just for making things compatible during the transition to the auto-
parser.  However, it seems that the static configurations do more harmful
than good, as some of entries don't match with the actual hardware setups.
