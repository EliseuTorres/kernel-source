Subject: [PATCH v2 22/31] drivers/net: delete non-required instances of
 include <linux/init.h>
Patch-mainline: v3.14-rc1

Git-commit: a81ab36bf52d0ca3a32251a923be1dbced726141 (partial)
References: bsc#908686 FATE#317538


None of these files are actually using any __init type directives
and hence don't need to include <linux/init.h>.   Most are just a
left over from __devinit and __cpuinit removal, or simply due to
code getting copied from one driver to the next.

This covers everything under drivers/net except for wireless, which
has been submitted separately.
