Subject: igb: do not force retry count to 1 on 82580 phy
References: FATE#311863 ,bnc#699089
Patch-mainline: v2.6.33-rc3
Git-commit: 8c6af2995c14e71558c312b86955ae32272a03d8

This change resolves an issue seen in some configurations where the link
may drop to 100Mb/s even though the link itself supports 1000Mb/s.  The
issue was root caused to the fact that we were only trying the link once.
Now instead we will try up to 5 attempts on a faulty cable before
downshifting to 100Mb/s.
