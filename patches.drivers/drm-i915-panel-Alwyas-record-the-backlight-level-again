Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/panel: Alwyas record the backlight level again (but
 cleverly) (v2)
Git-commit: f52c619a590fa75276c07dfcaf380dee53e4ea4c
Patch-mainline: 3.2-rc1
References: bnc#720996

The commit 47356eb67285014527a5ab87543ba1fae3d1e10a introduced a
mechanism to record the backlight level only at disabling time, but it
also introduced a regression.  Since intel_lvds_enable() may be called
without disabling (e.g. intel_lvds_commit() calls it unconditionally),
the backlight gets back to the last recorded value.  For example, this
happens when you dim the backlight, close the lid and open the lid,
then the backlight suddenly goes to the brightest.

This patch fixes the bug by recording the backlight level always
when changed via intel_panel_set_backlight().  And,
intel_panel_{enable|disable}_backlight() call the internal function not
to update the recorded level wrongly.

V1->v2: make an internal intel_panel_actually_set_backlight() and call from
  enable/disable functions for tracking the level during disabled too.
