The pcc-cpufreq driver is not automatically loaded on systems where
the platform's power management setting requires this driver.
Instead, on those systems no CPU frequency driver is registered and
active.

Make the autoloading matching criteria for loading the pcc-cpufreq
driver the same as done in acpi-cpufreq by commit c655affbd524d01
("ACPI / cpufreq: Add ACPI processor device IDs to acpi-cpufreq").

x86 CPU frequency drivers are now typically autoloaded by specifying
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE entries and x86cpu model specific matching.
But pcc-cpufreq was omitted when acpi-cpufreq and other drivers were
changed to use this approach.

Both acpi-cpufreq and pcc-cpufreq depend on a distinct and mutually
exclusive set of ACPI methods which are not directly tied to specific
processor model numbers. Both of these drivers have init routines
which look for their required ACPI methods. As a result, only the
appropriate driver registers as the cpu frequency driver and the other
one ends up being unloaded.

Tested on various systems where acpi-cpufreq, intel_pstate, and
pcc-cpufreq are the expected cpu frequency drivers.
