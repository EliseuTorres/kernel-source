Subject: igb: change descriptor control thresholds
References: FATE#311863 ,bnc#699089
Patch-mainline: v2.6.34-rc1
Git-commit: 58fd62f525e1182fbb2f7566aecb4545720d9aad

This change simplifies the code by setting RX_PTHRESH to 8 for
all devices, as it was unlikely that there was any advantage to
set it at 16 for earlier cards. Additionally TX_WTHRESH is
set to 1 for the 82576 NIC to improve performance by enabling
a minimal amount of write combining when writing back descriptors.
