Subject: intel_pstate: remove setting P state to MAX on init
Git-commit: d40a63c45b506b0681918d7c62a15cc9d48c8681
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc6
References: bnc#907973, FATE#316038

Setting the P state of the core to max at init time is a hold over
from early implementation of intel_pstate where intel_pstate disabled
cpufreq and loaded VERY early in the boot sequence.  This was to
ensure that intel_pstate did not affect boot time. This in not needed
now that intel_pstate is a cpufreq driver.

Removing this covers the case where a CPU has gone through a manual
CPU offline/online cycle and the P state is set to MAX on init and the
CPU immediately goes idle.  Due to HW coordination the P state request
on the idle CPU will drag all cores to MAX P state until the load is
reevaluated when to core goes non-idle.
