Subject: [PATCH 13/91] bnx2x: Don't receive packets when the napi budget == 0
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
Git-commit: b3529744b412e9870c9e10fef874e3bee2af1afa
References: bsc#922056 FATE#318604

Processing any incoming packets with a with a napi budget of 0
is incorrect driver behavior.

This matters as netpoll will shortly call drivers with a budget of 0
to avoid receive packet processing happening in hard irq context.
