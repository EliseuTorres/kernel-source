Subject: [SCSI] hpsa: suppress excessively chatty error messages
Git-commit: 21b8e4ef0357041854819d0f97bf1052ab4763e6
References: FATE#313833
Patch-Mainline: v3.5

Default behavior for any CHECK CONDITION excepting a few special cases is to
print out certain parts of the sense buffer and the CDB.  Default behavior
should be to print nothing and let the upper layers or applications decide what
to do about these.  The same information is already available by setting the
appropriate bits of the scsi_logging_level kernel parameter or via
/proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level.
