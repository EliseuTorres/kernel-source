Subject: [PATCH 109/242] bnx2x: prevent crash in shutdown flow with CNIC
Patch-mainline: v3.11-rc6

Git-commit: 6ef5a92cdf5ee65578a287b9a030964b03a538ed
References: bsc#908684 FATE#317539


There might be a crash as during shutdown flow CNIC might try
to access resources already freed by bnx2x.
Change bnx2x_close() into dev_close() in __bnx2x_remove (shutdown flow)
to guarantee CNIC is notified of the device's change of status.
