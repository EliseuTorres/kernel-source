Subject: e1000e: reduce writes of RX producer ptr
References: bnc#699092, fate#311825
Patch-mainline: v2.6.35
Git-commit: 50849d792b97c546c45a6652a16ba9be7d635c69

Reduce number of writes to RX producer pointer.   When alloc'ing RX
buffers, only write the RX producer pointer once every
E1000_RX_BUFFER_WRITE (16) buffers created.
