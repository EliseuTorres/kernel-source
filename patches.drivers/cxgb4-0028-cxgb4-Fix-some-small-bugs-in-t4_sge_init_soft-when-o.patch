Subject: cxgb4: Fix some small bugs in t4_sge_init_soft() when our Page Size
 is 64KB
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
Git-commit: 92ddcc7b8f1c14aa9f3ec98b14bcd421b21b01e4
References: bnc#863619 FATE#315951

We'd come in with SGE_FL_BUFFER_SIZE[0] and [1] both equal to 64KB and the
extant logic would flag that as an error.
