Subject: [PATCH 433/497] i40e: don't spam the system log
Patch-mainline: v4.1-rc1
Git-commit: 94666990015a28d1880b56215bac081df218a4a1
References: bsc#922844 FATE#318525

The PF driver spams the system log with messages about VF VSI when VFs
are created, as well as each time they are reset. This is annoying, and
the information isn't even useful most of the time.

Remove this message to reduce user annoyance.
