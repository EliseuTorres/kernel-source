Subject: USB: storage: Remove unneeded SL11R unusual_devs entry
Patch-mainline: v2.6.35
Git-commit: 9ed3fd6c10a161626120862d39f0211657d7c876

It seems unlikely that this entry is needed anymore since the kernel
has logic to handle devices that poorly respond to INQUIRY. Since we
now have another entry with the same VID/PID but different flags, it's
a good time to attempt to clean this up.

The original submitter's email no longer works, so we'll keep an eye
out for any regression reports.
