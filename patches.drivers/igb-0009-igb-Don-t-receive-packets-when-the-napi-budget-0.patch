Subject: [PATCH 09/77] igb: Don't receive packets when the napi budget == 0
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
Git-commit: 57ba34c9b068f314b219affafc19a39f8735d5e8
References: bsc#922836 Fate#318523

Processing any incoming packets with a with a napi budget of 0
is incorrect driver behavior.

This matters as netpoll will shortly call drivers with a budget of 0
to avoid receive packet processing happening in hard irq context.
