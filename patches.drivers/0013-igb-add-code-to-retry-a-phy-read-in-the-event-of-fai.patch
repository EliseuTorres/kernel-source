Subject: igb: add code to retry a phy read in the event of failure on link check
References: FATE#311863 ,bnc#699089
Patch-mainline: v2.6.33-rc1
Git-commit: ab576389b733b458495529f81839f499b3fece78

This patch adds a retry to phy reads in the event of failure.  The original
code broke out of the loop on failure and this is a mistake as we should be
trying to do the read twice.
