Subject: [PATCH 190/242] bnx2x: More Shutdown revisions
Patch-mainline: v3.14-rc1

Git-commit: 5f6db130b5dab96eb1fe6b2c1d1131a74149f949
References: bsc#908684 FATE#317539


Submission d9aee59 "bnx2x: Don't release PCI bars on shutdown" separated
the PCI remove and shutdown flows, but pci_disable_device() is still
being called on both.
As a result, a dev_WARN_ONCE will be hit during shutdown for every bnx2x
VF probed on a hypervisor (as its shutdown callback will be called and later
pci_disable_sriov() will call its remove callback).

This calls the pci_disable_device() only on the remove flow.
