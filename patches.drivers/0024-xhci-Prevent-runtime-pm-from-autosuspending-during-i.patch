Subject: [PATCH 24/30] xhci: Prevent runtime pm from autosuspending during
 initialization
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
References: FATE#317453
Git-Commit: bcffae7708eb8352f44dc510b326541fe43a02a4
Patch-Mainline: v3.15

xHCI driver has its own pci probe function that will call usb_hcd_pci_probe
to register its usb-2 bus, and then continue to manually register the
usb-3 bus. usb_hcd_pci_probe does a pm_runtime_put_noidle at the end and
might thus trigger a runtime suspend before the usb-3 bus is ready.

Prevent the runtime suspend by increasing the usage count in the
beginning of xhci_pci_probe, and decrease it once the usb-3Â bus is
ready.

xhci-platform driver is not using usb_hcd_pci_probe to set up
busses and should not need to have it's usage count increased during probe.
