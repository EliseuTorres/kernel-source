Subject: [PATCH 29/91] bnx2x: update MAINTAINERS for bnx2x and e-mail
 addresses
Patch-mainline: v3.16-rc1
Git-commit: 08f6dd89d26f8599dd138c25506960e3856fd062
References: bsc#922056 FATE#318604

The bnx2x development team has transferred from Broadcom to Qlogic.
This patch updates some obsolete email addresses to usable ones.
The bnx2x files contain headers with legal information from
Broadcom. Qlogic Legal depratment is taking their time coming up
with their own legal info. So this patch only updates contact
information. I will follow up with a patch for the headers once I
have the required info.
