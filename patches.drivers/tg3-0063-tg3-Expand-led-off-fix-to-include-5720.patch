Subject: [PATCH 063/108] tg3: Expand led off fix to include 5720
Patch-mainline: v3.12-rc2
Git-commit: 300cf9b93f74c3d969a0ad50bdac65416107c44c
References: bsc#908458 FATE#317507


Commit 989038e217e94161862a959e82f9a1ecf8dda152 ("tg3: Don't turn off
led on 5719 serdes port 0") added code to skip turning led off on port
0 of the 5719 since it powered down other ports. This workaround needs
to be enabled on the 5720 as well.
