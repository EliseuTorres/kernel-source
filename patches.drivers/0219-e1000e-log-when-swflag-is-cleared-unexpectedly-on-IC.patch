Subject: e1000e: log when swflag is cleared unexpectedly on ICH/PCH devices
References: bnc#699092, fate#311825
Patch-mainline: v3.1-rc1?
Git-commit: c5caf4825b22957e4ad70fd94316e91ce8cfb51c

Since EXTCNF_CTRL.SWFLAG (used in the ownership arbitration of shared
resources, e.g. the PHY shared between the s/w, f/w, and h/w clients)
can be cleared by any of those clients, log a debug message when
software attempts to clear it and it is already cleared unexpectedly.
And since the swflag is cleared by a hardware reset, the driver does
not need to do that, but the mutex acquired when the bit is set must
still be cleared.
