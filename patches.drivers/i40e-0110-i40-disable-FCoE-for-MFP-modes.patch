Subject: [PATCH 110/497] i40: disable FCoE for MFP modes
Patch-mainline: v3.16-rc1
Git-commit: 566bb85db73969453791c05d7fbd83d488247b65
References: bsc#922844 FATE#318525

Currently FCoE is not supported with MFP modes, so this patch
makes sure it is disabled.

It is disabled by overriding HW FCoE capability, so that later
it can be re-enabled by just the SW upgrade.
