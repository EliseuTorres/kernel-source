Subject: [SCSI] hpsa: fix incorrect abort diagnostic message
Git-commit: d6ebd0f758bec06041442aa62c602281005fb9ef
References: FATE#313833
Patch-Mainline: v3.7

In the abort handler, when asked to abort a command which
is not known to the driver, SUCCESS is returned, but the
diagnostic message incorrectly indicates the abort failed.
