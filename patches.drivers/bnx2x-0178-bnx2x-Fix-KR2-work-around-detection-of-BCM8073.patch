Subject: [PATCH 178/242] bnx2x: Fix KR2 work-around detection of BCM8073
Patch-mainline: v3.13-rc8

Git-commit: f17e9fa5686ac21bce756638ef71160395880928
References: bsc#908684 FATE#317539


KR2 work-around is based on detecting non-KR2 devices which may not link up
in this mode. One such link-partner is the BCM8073 which has specific
advertisement characteristics in specific mode, and this condition was not set
correctly.
