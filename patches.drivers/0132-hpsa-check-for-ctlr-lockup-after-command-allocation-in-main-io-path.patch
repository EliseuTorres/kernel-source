Subject: hpsa: check for ctlr lockup after command allocation in main io path
Git-commit: 407863cb9daddd99000c70cffb7013f47f67b29c
Patch-mainline: v4.0-rc1
References: bsc#942743

Command allocation is the thing that takes the longest in the main i/o
path, so check for controller lockup immediately after this to prevent
submitting commands to locked up controller as much as possible.
