Subject: [PATCH] cdc-ether: clean packet filter upon probe
Git-Commit: c472ab68ad67db23c9907a27649b7dc0899b61f9
Patch-Mainline: v3.16
References: bnc#888926

There are devices that don't do reset all the way. So the packet filter should
be set to a sane initial value. Failure to do so leads to intermittent failures
of DHCP on some systems under some conditions.
