Subject: e1000e: Fix default interrupt throttle rate not set in NIC HW
Patch-mainline: v3.4-rc6
Git-commit: 727c356f4d799b53f94cf8fe43e19d64482348c7
References: bnc#795174 FATE#313648

Based on the original patch from  Ying Cai <ycai@google.com>
This change ensures that the itr/itr_setting adjustment logic is used,
even for the default/compiled-in value.

Context:
  When we changed the default InterruptThrottleRate value from default
  (3 = dynamic mode) to 8000 for example, only adapter->itr_setting
  (which controls interrupt coalescing mode) was set to 8000, but
  adapter->itr (which controls the value set in NIC register) was not
  updated accordingly. So from ethtool, it seemed the interrupt
  throttling is enabled at 8000 intr/s, but the NIC actually was
  running in dynamic mode which has lower CPU efficiency especially
  when throughput is not high.
