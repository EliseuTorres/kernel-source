Subject: PCI: Add ACS quirk for Emulex NICs
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git
Git-commit: 6a3763d1734bf133330dc8e246bf794b9e360e8a
References: bug#917089

As Skyhawk and BE3-R (both multi-function devices) don't advertise the
PCI-ACS capability, the vfio driver places all the functions of these
devices in a single IOMMU group.  Attaching (via PCI-passthru) two
different Skyhawk/BE3-R partitions (nPAR, Flex, etc. PFs) using vfio, to
different guests doesn't work as vfio only allows functions in *different*
IOMMU groups to be assigned to different guests.

As peer-to-peer access between PFs in Skyhawk/BE3-R is not possible, we can
treat them as "fully isolated" even though the device doesn't advertise
ACS.  Add a PCI quirk for Skyhawk and BE3-R chips to fix this problem.
