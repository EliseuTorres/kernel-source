Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/via - don't report presence on HPs with no presence support
Git-commit: cf55e904516947597d75fd3844acc24891a95772
Patch-mainline: 3.7-rc1
References: FATE#314106

If headphone jack can't detect plug presence, and we have the jack in
the jack table, snd_hda_jack_detect will return the plug as always
present (as it'll be considered as a phantom jack). The problem is that
when this happens, line out pins will always be disabled, resulting in
no sound if there are no headphones connected.

This was reported as a no sound problem after suspend on
http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1052499, since the bug doesn't manifests
on first initialization before the phantom jack is added, but on resume
we reexecute the initialization code, and via_hp_automute starts
reporting HP always present with the jack now on the table.
