Subject: [PATCH] i2c: export bit-banging algo functions
Git-commit: b0209b39951868069710c1e39ca14add9fa77ada
Patch-mainline: 3.4-rc1

i915 has a hw i2c controller (gmbus) but for a bunch of stupid reasons
we need to be able to fall back to the bit-banging algo on gpio pins.

The current code sets up a 2nd i2c controller for the same i2c bus using
the bit-banging algo. This has a bunch of issues, the major one being
that userspace can directly access this fallback i2c adaptor behind
the drivers back.

But we need to frob a few registers before and after using fallback
gpio bit-banging, so this horribly fails.

The new plan is to only set up one i2c adaptor and transparently fall
back to bit-banging by directly calling the xfer function of the bit-
banging algo in the i2c core.

To make that possible, export the 2 i2c algo functions.

V2: As suggested by Jean Delvare, simply export the i2c_bit_algo
vtable instead of the individual functions.
