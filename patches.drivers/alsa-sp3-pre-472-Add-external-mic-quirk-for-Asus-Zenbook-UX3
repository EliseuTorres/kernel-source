Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: HDA: Add external mic quirk for Asus Zenbook UX31E
Git-commit: 5ac57550f279c3d991ef0b398681bcaca18169f7
Patch-mainline: 3.4-rc6
References: FATE#314311

According to the reporter, external mic starts to work if the
laptop-dmic model is used. According to BIOS pin config, all
pins are consistent with the alc269vb_laptop_dmic fixup, except
for the external mic, which is not present.
