commit 9f49c37635d5c2a801f7670d5fbf0b25ec461f2c upstream.

irq_mask should include all IRQ bits that we want to mask, but atm we
set it incorrectly to the inverse of this. If the mask is used
subsequently to enable/disable some IRQ bits, we may unintentionally
unmask unrelated IRQs. I can't see any way that this can lead to a real
problem in the current -nightly code, since the first place the mask
will be used next (after a suspend/resume cycle) is in
valleyview_irq_postinstall(), but the mask is reset there to its proper
value.

This causes a problem in the upstream kernel though, where - due to another
issue - the mask is used in the above way to disable only the display IRQs.
This other issue is fixed by:

    drm/i915: vlv: fix display IRQ enable/disable

Interestingly, even with the above two bugs, we shouldn't in theory have
any real problems (arguably a famous last sentence:). That's because
even if we unmask something unintentionally via the VLV_IMR/VLV_IER
register the master IRQ masking bit in VLV_MASTER_IER is still set and
should prevent all i915 interrupts. According to my testing on an ASUS
T100 with DSI output this isn't the case at least with the
MIPIA_INTERRUPT. Leaving this one unmasked in IMR/IER, while having
VLV_MASTER_IER set to 0 may lead to a lockup during system suspend as
shown in the bugzilla ticket below. This fix should get rid of the
problem reported there in upstream and older kernels.
