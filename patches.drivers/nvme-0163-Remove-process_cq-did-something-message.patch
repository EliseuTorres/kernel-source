Subject: NVMe: Remove "process_cq did something" message
References: bnc#913030,FATE#317455
Patch-Mainline: v3.13
Git-commit: bc57a0f7a44cfcf3e9873f6c6b8dcecdca486b1f

I was originally intending to log the fact that the kthread had done
some work since it might help us find interrupt handling problems, but
that hasn't been done yet, and spamming the logs with this message is
just rude.
