Subject: ALSA: hda - Fix invalid Auto-Mute Mode enum from cxt codecs
Patch-mainline: Never, SP3 only
References: bnc#872188

The "Auto-Mute Mode" enum on Conexant codecs with auto-parser returns
an invalid value 2 although there are only two items.  Fix to return
the correct value 1.

The patch is specific to SP3 (or 3.8 and earlier kernel), but there
is no corresponding upstream fix since the code base has been changed
largely after 3.8.
