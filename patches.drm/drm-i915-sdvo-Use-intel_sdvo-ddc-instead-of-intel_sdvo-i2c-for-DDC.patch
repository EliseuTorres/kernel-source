Subject: drm/i915/sdvo: Use &intel_sdvo->ddc instead of intel_sdvo->i2c for DDC.
Patch-Mainline: Upstream

In intel_sdvo_get_lvds_modes() the wrong i2c adapter record is used
for DDC. Thus the code will always have to rely on a LVDS panel
mode supplied by VBT.
In most cases this succeeds, so this didn't get detected for quite
a while.

This regression seems to have been introduced in
