Subject: drm: don't unnecessarily enable the polling work
Git-commit: a4f968d8e50cb7810e08ebb9bf4c8f2b769fdac7
Patch-mainline: v3.8-rc1

... by properly checking connector->polled. This doesn't matter too
much because the polling work itself gets this slightly more right and
doesn't set repoll if there's nothing to do. But we can do better.

v2: Chris Wilson noticed that I broke polling, since repoll will never
ever be set true. Fix this up, and simplify the logic a bit while at
it.
