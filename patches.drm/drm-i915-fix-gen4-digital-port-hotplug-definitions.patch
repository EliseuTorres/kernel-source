Subject: drm/i915: fix gen4 digital port hotplug definitions

Apparently Bspec is wrong in this case here even for gm45. Note that
Bspec is horribly misguided on i965g/gm, so we don't have any other
data points besides that it seems to make machines work better.

With this changes all the bits in PORT_HOTPLUG_STAT for the digital
ports are ordered the same way. This seems to agree with what register
dumps from the hpd storm handling code shows, where the LIVE bit and
the short/long pulse STATUS bits light up at the same time with this
enumeration (but no with the one from Bspec).

Also tested on my gm45 which has two DP+ ports, and everything seems
to still work as expected.

[danvet: Add a big warning that Bspec seems to be wrong for these
bits, suggested by Jani.]
