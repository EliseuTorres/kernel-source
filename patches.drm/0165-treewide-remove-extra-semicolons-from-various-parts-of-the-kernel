Subject: treewide: remove extra semicolons from various parts of the kernel
Git-commit: 699324871fcc3650f2023c5e36cb119a92d7894b (partial)
Patch-mainline: v3.2-rc1
Patch-filtered: drivers/gpu/

This is a resend from the original, changing the title from PATCH to
RFC(since this is a review for commit, and I should have put that the first go around).
and also removing some of the commit's with ia64 and bash since it is significant.
let me know if I might have missed anything etc..
