Subject: [PATCH 0903/2588] drm/radeon/kms: fix shared ddc harder

This fixes a regression caused by b2ea4aa67bfd084834edd070e0a4a47857d6db59
due to the way shared ddc with multiple digital connectors was handled.

You generally have two cases where DDC lines are shared:
- HDMI + VGA
- HDMI + DVI-D

HDMI + VGA is easy to deal with because you can check the EDID for the
to see if the attached monitor is digital.  A shared DDC line with two
digital connectors is more complex.  You can't use the hdmi bits in the
EDID since they may not be there with DVI<->HDMI adapters.  In this case
all we can do is check the HPD pins to see which is connected as we have
no way of knowing using the EDID.
