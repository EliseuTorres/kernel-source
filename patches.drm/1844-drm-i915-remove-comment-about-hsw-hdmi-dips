Subject: drm/i915: remove comment about HSW HDMI DIPs
Git-commit: c30b61109021ecbc81966573862cf98f655e3531
Patch-mainline: v3.6-rc1

HSW support is now just like all the other generations: we send AVI
and SPD InfoFrames. There are other DIPs for HSW, but there are other
DIPs for the previous generations too. For each gen, we can see which
DIPs are missing by looking at the 'set_infoframes' function: we
explicitly disable the DIPs we're not using.
