Subject: [PATCH 0338/2588] drm/radeon/kms: change Kconfig text to reflect the
 new option.

Ingo pointed out that we really don't give the user enough warning to make
a decision here. So revise the Kconfig text with a better warning.

(cherry picked from commit 1ca137cdcd4e11af03dbe073d48a470b833a456d)

+	  This is a completely new driver. It's only part of the existing drm
+	  for compatibility reasons. It requires an entirely different graphics
+	  stack above it and works very differently from the old drm stack.
+	  i.e. don't enable this unless you know what you are doing it may

 	  When kernel modesetting is enabled the IOCTL of radeon/drm
