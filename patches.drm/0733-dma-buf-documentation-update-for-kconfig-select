Subject: dma-buf: Documentation update for Kconfig select
Git-commit: 081794564e3000e602de290d1121792c33b475a4
Patch-mainline: v3.3-rc1

As per Linus' comment, dma-buf Kconfig entry shouldn't have an option
text, but should be selected by the subsystems that use it.

Add this information in the documentation as well.
