Subject: [PATCH 2503/2588] drm/915: fix relaxed tiling on gen2: tile height

A tile on gen2 has a size of 2kb, stride of 128 bytes and 16 rows.

Userspace was broken and assumed 8 rows. Chris Wilson noted that the
kernel unfortunately can't reliable check that because libdrm rounds
up the size to the next bucket.
