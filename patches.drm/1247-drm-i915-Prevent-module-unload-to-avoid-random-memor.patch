Subject: [PATCH 1247/2588] drm/i915: Prevent module unload to avoid random
 memory corruption

The i915 driver has quite a few module unload bugs, the known ones at
least have fixes that are targeting 2.6.37. However, in order to
maintain a stable kernel, we should prevent this known random memory
corruption following driver unload. This should have very low impact on
normal users who are unlikely to need to unload the i915 driver.
