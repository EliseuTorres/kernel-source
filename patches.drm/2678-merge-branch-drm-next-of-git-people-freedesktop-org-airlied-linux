Subject: Merge branch 'drm-next' of git://people.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux
Git-commit: 612a9aab56a93533e76e3ad91642db7033e03b69
Patch-mainline: v3.7-rc1

Pull drm merge (part 1) from Dave Airlie:
 "So first of all my tree and uapi stuff has a conflict mess, its my
  fault as the nouveau stuff didn't hit -next as were trying to rebase
  regressions out of it before we merged.

  Highlights:
   - SH mobile modesetting driver and associated helpers
   - some DRM core documentation
   - i915 modesetting rework, haswell hdmi, haswell and vlv fixes, write
     combined pte writing, ilk rc6 support,
   - nouveau: major driver rework into a hw core driver, makes features
     like SLI a lot saner to implement,
   - psb: add eDP/DP support for Cedarview
   - radeon: 2 layer page tables, async VM pte updates, better PLL
     selection for > 2 screens, better ACPI interactions

  The rest is general grab bag of fixes.

  So why part 1? well I have the exynos pull req which came in a bit
  late but was waiting for me to do something they shouldn't have and it
  looks fairly safe, and David Howells has some more header cleanups
  he'd like me to pull, that seem like a good idea, but I'd like to get
  this merge out of the way so -next dosen't get blocked."

Tons of conflicts mostly due to silly include line changes, but mostly
mindless.  A few other small semantic conflicts too, noted from Dave's
pre-merged branch.
