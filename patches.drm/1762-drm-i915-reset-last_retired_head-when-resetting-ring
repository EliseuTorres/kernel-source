Subject: drm/i915: Reset last_retired_head when resetting ring
Git-commit: c3b20037926e607b6cdaecbf9d3103e2ca63bc31
Patch-mainline: v3.5-rc2

When we reset the ring control registers, including the HEAD and TAIL of
the ring, we also need to reset associated state. In this instance, we
were failing to reset the cached value of ring->last_retired_head and so
upon the first request for more space following a resume would
potentially (depending on a narrow race window) believe that the HEAD had
advanced much further than reality.

This is a regression from:
