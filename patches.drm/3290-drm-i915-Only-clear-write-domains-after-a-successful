Subject: drm/i915: Only clear write-domains after a successful wait-seqno
Git-commit: daa13e1ca587bc773c1aae415ed1af6554117bd4
Patch-mainline: v3.11-rc2
References: bnc#831422

In the introduction of the non-blocking wait, I cut'n'pasted the wait
completion code from normal locked path. Unfortunately, this neglected
that the normal path returned early if the wait returned early. The
result is that read-only waits may return whilst the GPU is still
writing to the bo.

Fixes regression from
