Subject: drm/i915: Silence the error message from i915_wait_request()
Git-commit: eadb29a9c52eb14a84b94fc29bb1cfa93ddc653e
Patch-mainline: v3.4-rc1

This error message has since been superseded by the hangcheck, and does
not add any salient information beyond that already printed by hangcheck
discovering the GPU hang that lead to i915_wait_request() bombing out in
the first place.
