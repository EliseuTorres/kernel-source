Subject: crypto: rng - RNGs must return 0 in success case
Git-commit: cde001e4c3c3625c60b68a83eb1f1c2572dee07a
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/herbert/cryptodev-2.6.git
References: bsc#920805

Change the RNGs to always return 0 in success case.

This patch ensures that seqiv.c works with RNGs other than krng. seqiv
expects that any return code other than 0 is an error. Without the
patch, rfc4106(gcm(aes)) will not work when using a DRBG or an ANSI
X9.31 RNG.
