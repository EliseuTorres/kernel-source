Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: fix loop device on top of btrfs
Git-commit: 4a001071d3549f596c7c3736c5dda8a3a4aba9ed
Patch-mainline: v2.6.35-rc3

We cannot use the loop device which has been connected to a file in the btrf

The reproduce steps is following:
 # dd if=/dev/zero of=vdev0 bs=1M count=1024
 # losetup /dev/loop0 vdev0
 # mkfs.btrfs /dev/loop0
 ...
 failed to zero device start -5

The reason is that the btrfs don't implement either ->write_begin or ->write
the VFS API, so we fix it by setting ->write to do_sync_write().
