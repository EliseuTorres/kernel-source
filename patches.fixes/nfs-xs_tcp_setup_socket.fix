Subject: [PATCH] SUNRPC: close a rare race in xs_tcp_setup_socket.
References: bnc#794824
Patch-mainline: submitted for 3.13

We have one report of a crash in xs_tcp_setup_socket.
The call path to the crash is:

  xs_tcp_setup_socket -> inet_stream_connect -> lock_sock_nested.

The 'sock' passed to that last function is NULL.

The only way I can see this happening is a concurrent call to
xs_close:

  xs_close -> xs_reset_transport -> sock_release -> inet_release

inet_release sets:
   sock->sk = NULL;
inet_stream_connect calls
   lock_sock(sock->sk);
which gets NULL.

All calls to xs_close are protected by XPRT_LOCKED as are most
activations of the workqueue which runs xs_tcp_setup_socket.
The exception is xs_tcp_schedule_linger_timeout.

So presumably the timeout queued by the later fires exactly when some
other code runs xs_close().

To protect against this we can move the cancel_delayed_work_sync()
call from xs_destory() to xs_close().

As xs_close is never called from the worker scheduled on
->connect_worker, this can never deadlock.
