Subject: cifs: fix possible memory corruption in CIFSFindNext
References: bnc#714001, CVE-2011-3191
Patch-mainline: 3.1 (expected)
Git-commit: c32dfffaf59f73bbcf4472141b851a4dc5db2bf0
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git

The name_len variable in CIFSFindNext is a signed int that gets set to
the resume_name_len in the cifs_search_info. The resume_name_len however
is unsigned and for some infolevels is populated directly from a 32 bit
value sent by the server.

If the server sends a very large value for this, then that value could
look negative when converted to a signed int. That would make that
value pass the PATH_MAX check later in CIFSFindNext. The name_len would
then be used as a length value for a memcpy. It would then be treated
as unsigned again, and the memcpy scribbles over a ton of memory.

Fix this by making the name_len an unsigned value in CIFSFindNext.
