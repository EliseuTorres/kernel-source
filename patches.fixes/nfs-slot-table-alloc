Subject: Don't fail allocations for the slot table when mounting an NFS filesystem
Patch-mainline: no
References: bnc#519820

When the *_slot_table_entries exceeds 111, the slot_table_size
exceeds 32K and an order-4 allocation is forced.  This does not
retry nearly as much as order-3 so failure is more likely.
But mount and autofs in particular doesn't cope well with failure.
So force __GFP_REPEAT - the assumption is that people will only
set the slot_table_size sysctl large on a machine with plenty
of memory, so this should not block indefinitely.
