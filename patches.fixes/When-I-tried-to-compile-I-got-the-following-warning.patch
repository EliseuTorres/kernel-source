Subject: When I tried to compile I got the following warning:
Patch-mainline: v2.6.37

 fs/ocfs2/slot_map.c: In function ocfs2_init_slot_info:
 fs/ocfs2/slot_map.c:360: warning: bytes may be used uninitialized in this function
 fs/ocfs2/slot_map.c:360: note: bytes was declared here
 Compiler: gcc version 4.4.3 (GCC) on Mandriva
 I'm not sure why this warning occurs, I think compiler don't know that variable
 "bytes" is initialized when it is sent by reference to
 ocfs2_slot_map_physical_size and it throws that ugly warning.
 However, a simple initialization of "bytes" variable with 0 will fix it.
