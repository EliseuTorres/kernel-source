Subject: [PATCH] kvm: kvmclock: apply kvmclock offset to guest wall clock
 time
References: bnc#766445
Patch-Mainline: not yet

When a guest migrates to a new host, the system time difference from the
previous host is used in the updates to the kvmclock system time visible
to the guest, resulting in a continuation of correct kvmclock based guest
timekeeping.

The wall clock component of the kvmclock provided time is currently not
updated with this same time offset. Since the Linux guest caches the
wall clock based time, this discrepency is not noticed until the guest is
rebooted. After reboot the guest's time calculations are off.

This patch adjusts the wall clock by the kvmclock_offset, resulting in
correct guest time after a reboot.
