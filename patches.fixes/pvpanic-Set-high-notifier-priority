Subject: [PATCH] pvpanic: Set high notifier priority
Git-commit: 7939831eacd81fccbd7a956b30c7bb3abb9079db
Patch-mainline: 3.16-rc1
References: bnc#875220

We've observed the missing pvpanic call at panic, and it turned out
that this was blocked by the broken notifier of drm_fb_helper, where
scheduling may be called during switching to the fb console.
It's fairly difficult to fix the drm_fb problem and a quick fix isn't
foreseen, a simpler solution for the missing pvpanic call would be
just to call this earlier.

In order to assure that, this patch sets a higher priority to pvpanic
notifier_block.  Once when the issue of drm_fb is resolved, we can
remove this priority again.
