Subject: dcache: add missing lockdep annotation
Git-commit: 9f12600fe425bc28f0ccba034a77783c09c15af4
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc8
References: bnc#874025, bnc#881085

lock_parent() very much on purpose does nested locking of dentries, and
is careful to maintain the right order (lock parent first).  But because
it didn't annotate the nested locking order, lockdep thought it might be
a deadlock on d_lock, and complained.

Add the proper annotation for the inner locking of the child dentry to
make lockdep happy.

Introduced by commit 046b961b45f9 ("shrink_dentry_list(): take parent's
->d_lock earlier").
