Subject: md: try to remove cause of a spinning md thread.
Patch-mainline: not needed
References: bnc#875386

Received a report that md126_raid1 was  spinning while all other
CPUs were trying to stop_machine().

md126_raid1 was definitely spinning in and out of md_check_recovery and was
taking the mutex, but it is not clear why.

The only cases I can find were md_check_recovery would not clear the setting
that cause it to be entered are if ->safemode is 2 while mddev->external is set.

This can be fixed by ensuring we never set safemode to 2 for externally
managed arrays.
