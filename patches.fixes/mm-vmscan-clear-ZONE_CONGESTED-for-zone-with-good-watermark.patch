Subject: [PATCH] vmscan: clear ZONE_CONGESTED for zone with good watermark
References: MM fixes 3.0 to 3.1-rc4 not in -stable
Patch-mainline: yes
Git-commit: 439423f6894aa0dec22187526827456f5004baed

ZONE_CONGESTED is only cleared in kswapd, but pages can be freed in any
task.  It's possible ZONE_CONGESTED isn't cleared in some cases:

 1. the zone is already balanced just entering balance_pgdat() for
    order-0 because concurrent tasks free memory.  In this case, later
    check will skip the zone as it's balanced so the flag isn't cleared.

 2. high order balance fallbacks to order-0.  quote from Mel: At the
    end of balance_pgdat(), kswapd uses the following logic;

	If reclaiming at high order {
		for each zone {
			if all_unreclaimable
				skip
			if watermark is not met
				order = 0
				loop again

			/* watermark is met */
			clear congested
		}
	}

    i.e. it clears ZONE_CONGESTED if it the zone is balanced.  if not,
    it restarts balancing at order-0.  However, if the higher zones are
    balanced for order-0, kswapd will miss clearing ZONE_CONGESTED as
    that only happens after a zone is shrunk.  This can mean that
    wait_iff_congested() stalls unnecessarily.

This patch makes kswapd clear ZONE_CONGESTED during its initial
highmem->dma scan for zones that are already balanced.
