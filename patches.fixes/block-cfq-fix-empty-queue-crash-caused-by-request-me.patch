Subject: block, cfq: fix empty queue crash caused by request merge
Git-commit: 4a0b75c7d02c2bd46ed227d4ba5941ba8a0aba5d
References: bnc#778477
Patch-Mainline: v3.3

All requests of a queue could be merged to other requests of other queue.
Such queue will not have request in it, but it's in service tree. This
will cause kernel oops.
I encounter a BUG_ON() in cfq_dispatch_request() with next patch, but the
issue should exist without the patch.
