Subject: Fix deadlock when acquiring mutex while holding BKL
References: bnc#590705
Patch-mainline: No (probably 2.6.34)

Currently, we can hit a nasty case with optimistic spinning on mutexes:

CPU A tries to take a mutex, while holding the BKL

CPU B tried to take the BLK while holding the mutex

This looks like a AB-BA scenario but in practice, is allowed and happens
due to the auto-release-on-schedule nature of the BKL.

In that case, the optimistic spinning code can get us into a situation
where instead of going to sleep, A will spin waiting for B who is
spinning waiting for A, and the only way out of that loop is the
need_resched() test in mutex_spin_on_owner().

Now, that's bad enough since we may end up having those two processors
deadlocked for a while, thus introducing latencies, but I've had cases
where it completely stopped making forward progress. I suspect CPU A
had nothing else waiting to run, and see need_resched() was never set.

This patch fixes both in a rather crude way. I completely disable
spinning if we own the BKL, and I add a safety timeout using jiffies
to fallback to sleeping if we end up spinning for more than 1 or 2 jiffies.

Now, we -could- make it a bit smarter about the BKL by introducing a
contention counter and only go out if we own the BKL and it is contended,
but I didn't feel like this was worth the effort, time is better spent
removing the BKL from sensitive code path instead.

Regarding the choice of 1 or 2 jiffies, it's completely arbitrary. I
prefer that to an arbitrary number of milliseconds mostly because it's
expected that a 1000HZ kernel is run on a workload that expects smaller
latencies, and as such reflects better the idea that if we're going
to spin for more than a scheduler tick, we may as well schedule (and
save power by doing so if we hit the idle thread).

This timeout is also a safeguard in case we find another weird deadlock
scenario with optimistic spinning (that's the second one I found so far,
the other one was with CPU hotplug). At least we have some kind of
forward progress guarantee now.
