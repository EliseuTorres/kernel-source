Subject: mm/memory_hotplug.c: fix building of node hotplug zonelist
References: fate#311831,bnc#703100
Patch-Mainline: v3.0-rc4
Git-commit: 959ecc48fc7506b9d7825ea70e40d92d9b308033

During memory hotplug we refresh zonelists when we online a page in a new
zone.  It means that the node's zonelist is not initialized until pages
are onlined.  So for example, "nid" passed by MEM_GOING_ONLINE notifier
will point to NODE_DATA(nid) which has no zone fallback list.  Moreover,
if we hot-add cpu-only nodes, alloc_pages() will do no fallback.

This patch makes a zonelist when a new pgdata is available.

Note: in production, at fujitsu, memory should be onlined before cpu
      and our server didn't have any memory-less nodes and had no problems.

      But recent changes in MEM_GOING_ONLINE+page_cgroup
      will access not initialized zonelist of node.
      Anyway, there are memory-less node and we need some care.
