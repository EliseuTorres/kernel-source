Subject: mm/vmscan: restore sc->gfp_mask after promoting it to __GFP_HIGHMEM
Git-commit: 619d0d76c1ee943f171c7d4fc021ec7602388579
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1
References: VM Cleanup, bnc#904177

We promote sc->gfp_mask to __GFP_HIGHMEM to forcibly scan highmem if
there are too many buffer_heads pinning highmem.  See cc715d99e5 ("mm:
vmscan: forcibly scan highmem if there are too many buffer_heads pinning
highmem").

This patch restores sc->gfp_mask to its caller original value after
finishing the scan job, to avoid the impact on other invocations from
its upper caller, such as vmpressure_prio(), shrink_slab().
