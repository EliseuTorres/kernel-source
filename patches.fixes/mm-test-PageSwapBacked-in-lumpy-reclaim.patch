Subject: [PATCH] mm: test PageSwapBacked in lumpy reclaim
References: Improve preservation of page-age information
Patch-mainline: yes
Git-commit: 043bcbe5ec51e0478ef2b44acef17193e01d7f70

Lumpy reclaim does well to stop at a PageAnon when there's no swap, but
better is to stop at any PageSwapBacked, which includes shmem/tmpfs too.
