Subject: jsm: Fixed EEH recovery error
Patch-mainline: pending
References: bnc#721239

There was an error on the jsm driver that would cause it to be unable to
recover after a second error is detected.

At the first error, the device recovers properly:

[72521.485691] EEH: Detected PCI bus error on device 0003:02:00.0
[72521.485695] EEH: This PCI device has failed 1 times in the last hour:
...
[72532.035693] ttyn3 at MMIO 0x0 (irq = 49) is a jsm
[72532.105689] jsm: Port 3 added

However, at the second error, it cascades until EEH disables the device:

[72631.229549] Call Trace:
...
[72641.725687] jsm: Port 3 added
[72641.725695] EEH: Detected PCI bus error on device 0003:02:00.0
[72641.725698] EEH: This PCI device has failed 3 times in the last hour:

It was caused because the PCI state was not being saved after the first
restore. Therefore, at the second recovery the PCI state would not be
restored.
