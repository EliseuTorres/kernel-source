Subject: libfc: fix setting of rport dev loss
Patch-Mainline: Submitted to linux-scsi
References: bnc#650116

There does not seem to be a reason why libfc adds a 5
second delay to the user requested value for the dev loss
tmo. There also does not seem to be a reason to allow
setting it to 0 (or really close).

This patch removes the extra 5 sec delay, and for 0 it
sets it to 1 like other fc drivers. We should actually
be able to set it to 0 since the queue_delayed_work API
will just call queue_work, but other drivers set it to 1 in
that case.
