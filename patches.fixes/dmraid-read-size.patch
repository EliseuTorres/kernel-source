Subject: Support dm-raid on large-sector devices
Patch-mainline: not yet
References: bnc#884407

On devices with a 4K sectors size, ra_disk_sb() will fail as
rdev->sb_size is less than 4K.
The buffer being read into is 1 page, so 4K is safe providing
the metadata isn't at the very end of the device, which it isn'.t
