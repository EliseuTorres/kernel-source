Subject: [PATCH] don't busy retry the inode on failed grab_super_passive()
Git-commit: 0e995816f4fb69cef602b7fe82da68ced6be3b41
Patch-mainline: 3.1-rc1

This fixes a soft lockup on conditions

a) the flusher is working on a work by __bdi_start_writeback(), while

b) someone else calls writeback_inodes_sb*() or sync_inodes_sb(), which
   grab sb->s_umount and enqueue a new work for the flusher to execute

The s_umount grabbed by (b) will fail the grab_super_passive() in (a).
Then if the inode is requeued, wb_writeback() will busy retry on it.
As a result, wb_writeback() loops for ever without releasing
wb->list_lock, which further blocks other tasks.

Fix the busy loop by redirtying the inode. This may undesirably delay
the writeback of the inode, however most likely it will be picked up
soon by the queued work by writeback_inodes_sb*(), sync_inodes_sb() or
even writeback_inodes_wb().
