Subject: [PATCH] proc: enable writing to /proc/pid/mem
Patch-mainline: never
References: bnc#742279 CVE-2012-0056

The issue is fixed by e268337 [proc: clean up and fix /proc/<pid>/mem handling]
upstream but the easier way to fix is just to revert the original patch
(198214a7) and disable writing as we do not have to support it anyway. Sle11sp1
didn't enable it and nobody requested this as a feature.
