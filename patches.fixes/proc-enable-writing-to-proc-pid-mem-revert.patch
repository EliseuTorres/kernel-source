Subject: [PATCH] proc: enable writing to /proc/pid/mem
Patch-mainline: v2.6.39-rc1
References: bnc#742279 CVE-2012-0056
Git-commit: 198214a7ee50375fa71a65e518341980cfd4b2f0

mhocko:
The issue is fixed by e268337 [proc: clean up and fix /proc/<pid>/mem handling]
but the easier way to fix is just to disable writing as we do not have
to support it anyway. Sle11sp1 didn't enable it and nobody requested this
as a feature.

With recent changes there is no longer a security hazard with writing to
/proc/pid/mem.  Remove the #ifdef.
