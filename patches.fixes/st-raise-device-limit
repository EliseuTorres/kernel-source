Subject: [PATCH 5/5] st: raise device limit
Patch-mainline: Submitted May 2012 to scsi
References: bnc#760806

From: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>

The device limit of 128 tape drives was established in 2003 as a
significant increase from the 8 tape drives allowed previously.

We're seeing customer sites that between a large number of drives
and multipath are discovering more than 128 devices and running
into problems.

Now that we're not stuck having to store a pointer in array
and aren't limited by kmalloc failing on higher order allocs we can
lift the limit to fill the entire minor range based on the number
of modes.

Based on the current code, that's 2^17 devices.
