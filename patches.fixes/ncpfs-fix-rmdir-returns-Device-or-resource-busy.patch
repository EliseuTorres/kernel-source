Subject: [PATCH] ncpfs: fix rmdir returns Device or resource busy
References: bnc#864880
Git-commit: 698b8223631472bf982ed570b0812faa61955683
Patch-mainline: v3.10-rc6

1d2ef5901483004d74947bbf78d5146c24038fe7 caused a regression in ncpfs such that
directories could no longer be removed.  This was because ncp_rmdir checked
to see if a dentry could be unhashed before allowing it to be removed. Since
1d2ef5901483004d74947bbf78d5146c24038fe7 introduced a change that incremented
dentry->d_count causing it to always be greater than 1 unhash would always
fail.  Thus causing the error path in ncp_rmdir to always be taken.  Removing
this error path is safe as unhashing is still accomplished by calls to dput
from vfs_rmdir.
