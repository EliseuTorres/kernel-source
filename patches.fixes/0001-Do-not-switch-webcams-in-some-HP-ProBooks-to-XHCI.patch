Subject: [PATCH] Do not switch webcams in some HP ProBooks to XHCI
References: bnc#805804
Patch-Mainline: Never (upstream fix breaks kABI)

Some webcams in some HP ProBooks cannot operate reliably
with XHCI (great package loss). As some other cameras do
work it is unlikely to be a bug in uvcvideo. For now, keep
all cameras at EHCI.
