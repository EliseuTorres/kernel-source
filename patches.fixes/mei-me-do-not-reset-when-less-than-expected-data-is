Subject: [PATCH] mei: me: do not reset when less than expected data is received
Git-commit: b1b94b5d387e3a1f034c308e22f9295828d7174a
Patch-mainline: 3.15-rc1
References: bnc#821619,bnc#852656

There is a race in ME hardware between data copy for host and interrupt
delivery. An interrupt can be delivered prior to whole data copied for the
host to read but rather then going trough the reset we just merely need to
wait for the next interrupt.

The bug is visible in read/write stress with multiple connections per client

This is a regression caused as a side effect of the commit:
commit 544f94601409653f07ae6e22d4a39e3a90dceead
Mei: do not run reset flow from the interrupt thread
