Subject: NFS: avoid mountpoint being " (deleted)" in /proc/mounts.
Patch-mainline: not relevant
References: bnc#888591

A recent patch invalidated NFS dentries in some circumstances in order
to force a "readdirplus", which is a lot more efficient.

These circumstances included a case where the dentry was the root
of a mount.
This causes the entry in '/proc/mounts' to contain the string "(deleted)".

This particularly affects NFS mounted via autofs.

This is fixed by adding a test for LOOKUP_JUMPED which mean were
weren't looking up the dentry by name, so invalidating the name
to encourage readdirplus is pointless
