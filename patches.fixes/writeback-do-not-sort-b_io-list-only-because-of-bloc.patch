Subject: [PATCH] writeback: Do not sort b_io list only because of block device
 inode
References: bnc#819018
Patch-mainline: 3.12
Git-commit: a8855990e382fc81c04187c5fdb48743307baf32

It is very likely that block device inode will be part of BDI dirty list
as well. However it doesn't make sence to sort inodes on the b_io list
just because of this inode (as it contains buffers all over the device
anyway). So save some CPU cycles which is valuable since we hold relatively
contented wb->list_lock.
