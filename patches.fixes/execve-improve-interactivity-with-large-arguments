execve: improve interactivity with large arguments

This adds a preemption point during the copying of the argument and
environment strings for execve, in copy_strings().  There is already
a preemption point in the count() loop, so this doesn't add any new
points in the abstract sense.

When the total argument+environment strings are very large, the time
spent copying them can be much more than a normal user time slice.
So this change improves the interactivity of the rest of the system
when one process is doing an execve with very large arguments.
