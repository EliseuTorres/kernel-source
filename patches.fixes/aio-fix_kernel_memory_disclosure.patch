Subject: aio: fix kernel memory disclosure in io_getevents() introduced in v3.10
Git-commit: edfbbf388f293d70bf4b7c0bc38774d05e6f711a
Patch-mainline: v3.16-rc3
Reference: bnc#884324
    
A kernel memory disclosure was introduced in aio_read_events_ring() in v3.10
by commit a31ad380bed817aa25f8830ad23e1a0480fef797.  The changes made to
aio_read_events_ring() failed to correctly limit the index into
ctx->ring_pages[], allowing an attacked to cause the subsequent kmap() of
an arbitrary page with a copy_to_user() to copy the contents into userspace.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-0206.  Thanks to Mateusz and
Petr for disclosing this issue.

This patch applies to v3.12+.  A separate backport is needed for 3.10/3.11.

Note: Modified the patch such that only head is assigned but tail isn't touched.
