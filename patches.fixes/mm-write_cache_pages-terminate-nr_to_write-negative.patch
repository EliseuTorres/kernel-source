Subject: writeback: write_cache_pages doesn't terminate at nr_to_write <= 0
Git-commit: 546a1924224078c6f582e68f890b05b387b42653
References: bnc#699354
Patch-mainline: 2.6.36-rc3

I noticed XFS writeback in 2.6.36-rc1 was much slower than it should have
been. Enabling writeback tracing showed:

    flush-253:16-8516  [007] 1342952.351608: wbc_writepage: bdi 253:16: towrt=1024 skip=0 mode=0 kupd=0 bgrd=1 reclm=0 cyclic=1 more=0 older=0x0 start=0x0 end=0x0
    flush-253:16-8516  [007] 1342952.351654: wbc_writepage: bdi 253:16: towrt=1023 skip=0 mode=0 kupd=0 bgrd=1 reclm=0 cyclic=1 more=0 older=0x0 start=0x0 end=0x0
    flush-253:16-8516  [000] 1342952.369520: wbc_writepage: bdi 253:16: towrt=0 skip=0 mode=0 kupd=0 bgrd=1 reclm=0 cyclic=1 more=0 older=0x0 start=0x0 end=0x0
    flush-253:16-8516  [000] 1342952.369542: wbc_writepage: bdi 253:16: towrt=-1 skip=0 mode=0 kupd=0 bgrd=1 reclm=0 cyclic=1 more=0 older=0x0 start=0x0 end=0x0
    flush-253:16-8516  [000] 1342952.369549: wbc_writepage: bdi 253:16: towrt=-2 skip=0 mode=0 kupd=0 bgrd=1 reclm=0 cyclic=1 more=0 older=0x0 start=0x0 end=0x0

Writeback is not terminating in background writeback if ->writepage is
returning with wbc->nr_to_write == 0, resulting in sub-optimal single page
writeback on XFS.

Fix the write_cache_pages loop to terminate correctly when this situation
occurs and so prevent this sub-optimal background writeback pattern. This
improves sustained sequential buffered write performance from around
250MB/s to 750MB/s for a 100GB file on an XFS filesystem on my 8p test VM.
