Subject: [PATCH] floppy: do not corrupt bio.bi_flags when reading block 0
References: bnc#879258
Patch-mainline: queued in subsystem tree as 6314a108ec1, likely for 3.16

Commit 41a55b4de39 ("floppy: silence warning during disk test") caused
bio.bi_flags being overwritten, and its initialization to BIO_UPTODATE
in bio_init() to be lost.

This was unnoticed until 7b7b68bba5 ("floppy: bail out in open() if
drive is not responding to block0 read"), because the error value wasn't
checked for in the bio completion callback.

Now we are actually looking at the error, and the loss of BIO_UPTODATE
causes EIO to be wrongly passed to the callback, which confuses the
FD_OPEN_SHOULD_FAIL_BIT logic.

Fix this by not destroying previous value of bi_flags when setting
BIO_QUIET.
