Subject: [PATCH] mm: kswapd: stop high-order balancing when any suitable zone is balanced
Patch-mainline: 9950474883e027e6e728cbcff25f7f2bf0c96530
References: bnc#682567

Simon Kirby reported the following problem

   We're seeing cases on a number of servers where cache never fully
   grows to use all available memory.  Sometimes we see servers with 4 GB
   of memory that never seem to have less than 1.5 GB free, even with a
   constantly-active VM.  In some cases, these servers also swap out while
   this happens, even though they are constantly reading the working set
   into memory.  We have been seeing this happening for a long time; I
   don't think it's anything recent, and it still happens on 2.6.36.

After some debugging work by Simon, Dave Hansen and others, the prevaling
theory became that kswapd is reclaiming order-3 pages requested by SLUB
too aggressive about it.

There are two apparent problems here.  On the target machine, there is a
small Normal zone in comparison to DMA32.  As kswapd tries to balance all
zones, it would continually try reclaiming for Normal even though DMA32
was balanced enough for callers.  The second problem is that
sleeping_prematurely() does not use the same logic as balance_pgdat() when
deciding whether to sleep or not.  This keeps kswapd artifically awake.

A number of tests were run and the figures from previous postings will
look very different for a few reasons.  One, the old figures were forcing
my network card to use GFP_ATOMIC in attempt to replicate Simon's problem.
 Second, I previous specified slub_min_order=3 again in an attempt to
reproduce Simon's problem.  In this posting, I'm depending on Simon to say
whether his problem is fixed or not and these figures are to show the
impact to the ordinary cases.  Finally, the "vmscan" figures are taken
from /proc/vmstat instead of the tracepoints.  There is less information
but recording is less disruptive.

The first test of relevance was postmark with a process running in the
background reading a large amount of anonymous memory in blocks.  The
objective was to vaguely simulate what was happening on Simon's machine
and it's memory intensive enough to have kswapd awake.

Performance is mildly affected because kswapd is no longer doing as much
work and the background memory consumer process is getting in the way.
Note that kswapd scanned and reclaimed fewer pages as it's less aggressive
and overall fewer pages were scanned and reclaimed.  Swap in/out is
particularly reduced again reflecting kswapd throwing out fewer pages.

The slight performance impact is unfortunate here but it looks like a
direct result of kswapd being less aggressive.  As the bug report is about
too many pages being freed by kswapd, it may have to be accepted for now.

The second test is a streaming IO benchmark that was previously used by
Johannes to show regressions in page reclaim.

Again fewer pages are scanned and reclaimed as expected and this time the
test completed faster.  Note that kswapd is hitting its watermarks faster
(low and high wmark quickly) which I expect is due to kswapd reclaiming
fewer pages.

I also ran fs-mark, iozone and sysbench but there is nothing interesting
to report in the figures.  Performance is not significantly changed and
the reclaim statistics look reasonable.

Tgis patch:

When the allocator enters its slow path, kswapd is woken up to balance the
node.  It continues working until all zones within the node are balanced.
For order-0 allocations, this makes perfect sense but for higher orders it
can have unintended side-effects.  If the zone sizes are imbalanced,
kswapd may reclaim heavily within a smaller zone discarding an excessive
number of pages.  The user-visible behaviour is that kswapd is awake and
reclaiming even though plenty of pages are free from a suitable zone.

This patch alters the "balance" logic for high-order reclaim allowing
kswapd to stop if any suitable zone becomes balanced to reduce the number
of pages it reclaims from other zones.  kswapd still tries to ensure that
order-0 watermarks for all zones are met before sleeping.
