Subject: export __wake_up_locked_key as may be needed for NFS update
Patch-mainline: 2.6.38
References: FATE#310250

If we create a KMP for pNFS it will essientially require backporting
all of sunrpc and nfs from a newer kernel.  This is almost entirely
self contained in those modules, however commit bf294b41cefcb22fc3139
requires this symbol to be exported, so export in now to avoid any 
possible difficulty later.
